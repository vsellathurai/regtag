This is a project to loop through selected regulation articles    
and assigned articles into different buckets and hence linked to     
Bloomberg products to produce an overview of:        
       
1) Pattern of new regulation releases     
2) How regulation releases can be tackled with Bloomberg Products     
3) What are the key words that appear in regulation articles       
      
```
raw text from BBOT --> tokenization --> removing noise: stem/POS tags     
         
     1) Key words of each bucket                              
-->                                                  
     2) Key words of each products within the bucket      
	      
            1) four buckets
