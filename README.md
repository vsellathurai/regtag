# REG-TAG

### Goal:

Financial regulatory bodies worldwide are working doubly hard to create a prudent and safe environment for banks, businesses and communities to reap the benefits of the system. As such, many regulatory bodies put up Consultation Papers (CPs) to discuss impending regulations.

The aim of this project is to digest CPs down and find their relationship against larger regulatory framework such as MiFID, BASEL III, Dodd-Frank etc. This could be extremely beneficial for major banks operating in multiple locations in understanding the local regulatory environment.

### Process:

There are 2 main approaches/parts to the end goal:

#### 1. Mapping consultation papers to e.g MiFID
