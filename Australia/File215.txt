Comments close 23 November 2016. This consultation paper sets out ASIC’s proposals to remake our class order on on-market buy-backs by ASX-listed schemes. Under the Legislation Act 2003, this class order will expire (‘sunset’) if not remade. We are seeking feedback from responsible entities of registered managed investment schemes on our proposal to remake, without significant changes, Class Order [CO 07/422] On-market buy-backs by ASX-listed schemes, which is due to expire on 1 April 2018. This paper also seeks feedback on our draft updated Regulatory Guide 101 Managed investment scheme buy-backs (draft updated RG 101), which provides guidance on our relief for managed investment scheme buy-backs.
