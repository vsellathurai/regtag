COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) …/.. 

of [date] 

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament 

and of the Council on markets in financial instruments with regard to 

regulatory technical standards on transparency requirements for trading 

venues and investment firms in respect of shares, depositary receipts, 

exchange-traded funds, certificates and other similar financial instruments 
and the obligation for investment firms to execute transactions in certain 

shares on a trading venue or a systematic internaliser  

(Text with EEA relevance) 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/20121, and in particular Articles 4(6), 7(2), 14(7), 20(3), 22(4) and 23(3) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

A  high  degree  of  transparency  is  essential  to  ensure  that  investors  are  adequately 
informed as to the true level of actual and potential transactions in shares, depositary 
receipts,  exchange-traded  funds  (ETFs),  certificates  and  other  similar  financial 
instruments irrespective of whether those transactions take place on regulated markets, 
multilateral  trading  facilities  (MTFs),  systematic  internalisers,  or  outside  those 
facilities. This high degree of transparency should also establish a level playing field 
between  trading  venues  so  that  the  price  discovery  process  in  respect  of  particular 
financial  instruments  is  not  impaired  by  the  fragmentation  of  liquidity,  and  investors 
are not thereby penalised.  

At  the  same  time,  it  is  essential  to  recognise  that  there  may  be  circumstances  where 
exemptions  from  pre-trade  transparency  or  deferrals  from  post-trade  transparency 
obligations should be provided to avoid the impairment of liquidity as an unintended 
consequence  of  obligations  to  disclose  orders  and  transactions  and  thereby  to  make 
public risk positions. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify the precise circumstances

under  which  waivers  from  pre-trade  transparency  and  deferrals  from  post-trade 
transparency may be granted. 

The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  the 
transparency  requirements  applicable  to  trading  venues  and  investment  firms  in 
respect  of  shares,  depositary  receipts,  ETFs,  certificates  and  other  similar  financial 
instruments.  To  ensure  coherence  between  those  provisions,  which  should  enter  into 
force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and efficient access for 
stakeholders,  in  particular  those  subject  to  the  obligations,  it  is  desirable  to  include 
these regulatory technical standards in a single Regulation.  

(4)

  Where  competent  authorities  grant  waivers  in  relation  to  pre-trade  transparency 
requirements  or  authorise  the  deferral  of  post-trade  transparency  obligations,  they 
should treat  all regulated markets,  multilateral  trading  facilities and investment firms 
trading outside of trading venues equally and in a non-discriminatory manner. 

(5)

 

(6)

 

(7)

 

It  is  appropriate  to  provide  for  clarification  of  a  limited  number  of  technical  terms. 
Those  technical  definitions  are  necessary  to  ensure  the  uniform  application  in  the 
Union  of  the  provisions  contained  in  this  Regulation  and,  hence,  contribute  to  the 
establishment  of  a  single  rulebook  for  financial  markets  in  the  Union.  Those 
definitions  are  purely  functional  for  the  purpose  of  setting  out  the  transparency 
obligations  for  equity  and  equity-like  financial  instruments  and  should  be  strictly 
limited to understanding this Regulation. 

Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  brings  within  the  scope  of  the  transparency  regime 
equity-like  instruments  such  as  depositary  receipts,  ETFs  and  certificates,  as  well  as 
shares and other equity-like instruments only traded on a MTF. It is necessary, in order 
to establish a comprehensive and uniform transparency regime, to update Commission 
Regulation  (EC)  No  1287/2006  of  10  August  20062 by  calibrating  the  content  of  the 
pre-trade information to be made public by trading venues.  

A  trading  venue  operating  a  request  for  quote  (RFQ)  system  should  at  least  make 
public  all  the  firm  bid  and  offer  prices  or  actionable  indications  of  interest  and  the 
depth  attached  to  those  prices  no  later  than  at  the  time  when  the  requester  is  able  to 
execute  a  transaction  under  the  system’s  rules.  This  is  to  ensure  that  members  or 
participants  who  are  providing  their  quotes  to  the  requester  first  are  not  put  at  a 
disadvantage.

  While this Regulation sets out the specific methodology and data necessary to perform 
calculations for the purpose of specifying the transparency regime applicable to equity 

                                                 

2 Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1287/2006  of  10  August  2006  implementing  Directive  2004/39/EC  of  the 
European Parliament and of the Council as regards recordkeeping obligations for investment firms, transaction 
reporting, market transparency, admission of financial instruments to trading, and defined terms for the purposes 
of that Directive (OJ L 241, 2.9.2006, p. 1).

and  equity-like  financial  instruments,  it  should  be  applied  in  conjunction  with 
Regulation (EU) No [RTS on Article 22 and Double Volume Cap] which specifies in 
more general terms, the common elements with regard to the content and frequency of 
data requests to  be addressed to  trading venues,  Approved Publication Arrangements 
(APAs) and Consolidated Tape Providers (CTPs) for the purposes of transparency and 
other calculations.  

This  Regulation  should  ensure  that  the  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency  regime 
established by Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 is appropriately calibrated to the market. 
In particular, a static determination of the most relevant markets in terms of liquidity, 
the  sizes  of  orders  that  are  large  in  scale  and  standard  market  sizes  would  not 
adequately  capture  regular  modifications  of  trading  patterns  affecting  equity  and 
equity-like  instruments.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  that  this  Regulation  lays  down  the 
necessary calculations to be performed, including their periods and methods as well as 
the identification of the competent authority responsible for making the calculations in 
accordance with the determination of the relevant competent authority for the purpose 
of  Article  26  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  specified  in  Article  xx  of  Commission 
Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  [insert  reference  to  Article  18  of  RTS  on  reporting 
obligations  under  Article  26  of  MiFIR].  In  this  respect,  to  avoid  market  distorting 
effects,  the  calculation  periods  specified  in  this  Regulation  should  ensure  that  the 
relevant thresholds of the regime are updated at appropriate intervals to reflect market 
conditions. It is also appropriate to provide for the centralised publication of the results 
of the calculations so that they are made available to all financial market participants 
and competent authorities in the Union in a single place and in a user-friendly manner. 
To  that  end,  competent  authorities  should  notify  ESMA  of  the  results  of  their 
calculations and then ESMA should publish those calculations on its website.  

It  is  also  appropriate  to  ensure  that  the  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency  regime 
established by Regulation (EU) No 600/201 is applied in a uniform manner throughout 
the Union. In order to carry out the calculations for determining the requirements for 
the  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency  in  accordance  with  Article  22(1)  of 
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the content, frequency of data requests and the formats 
and  timeframe  in  which  trading  venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  must  respond  to  such 
requests in accordance with Article 22(4) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be 
developed.  The  results  of  the  calculations  made  on  the  basis  of  the  data  collected 
according  to  Article  22(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  need  to  be  published  in 
order  to  inform  market  participants  and  achieve  pre-  and  post-trade  transparency  in 
practice.  It is also appropriate to provide for the possibility of centralised publication 
of the results of the calculations so that they are made available to all financial market 
participants  and  competent  authorities  in  the  Union  in  a  single  place  and  in  a  user-
friendly manner. To that end, competent authorities should notify European Securities 
and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  of  the  results  of  their  calculations  and  then  ESMA 
should publish those calculations on its website.

  For  ETFs,  and  contrary  to  shares,  depositary  receipts,  certificates  and  other  similar 
financial  instruments,  the  average  daily  turnover  does  not  appear  as  an  appropriate 
proxy  for  the  calibration  of  the  large  in  scale  thresholds.  For  these  instruments,  the 
measure  of  actual  liquidity  is  not  adequately  captured  by  the  average  daily  turnover 
since  the  creation  and  redemption  mechanisms  inherent  to  ETFs  allow  to  access 
additional and non-displayed liquidity. In order to reduce the risk of circumvention, it 
is also important that two ETFs on the same underlying have the same large in scale 
thresholds  regardless  of  whether  they  have  similar  average  daily  turnover  or  not. 
Therefore,  this  Regulation  should  establish  a  single  large  in  scale  threshold  for  all 
ETFs which should apply regardless of their underlying or of their liquidity.  

(12)

 

(13)

 

Information  which  is  required  to  be  made  available  as  close  to  real  time  as  possible 
should  be  made  available  as  instantaneously  as  technically  possible,  assuming  a 
reasonable level of efficiency and of expenditure on systems on the part of the person 
concerned.  The  information  should  only  be  published  close  to  the  prescribed 
maximum time limit in exceptional cases where the systems available do not allow for 
publication in a shorter period of time. 

Investment  firms  should  make  public  the  details  of  transactions  executed  outside  a 
trading  venue  through  an  APA.  This  Regulation  should  set  out  the  way  investment 
firms  report  the  details  of  the  transactions  to  APAs  and  should  apply  in  conjunction 
with the Regulation on [RTS 13 on DRSP] where the specific requirements applicable 
to APAs are specified.  

(14)

  The  transparency  requirements  aim  to  ensure  that  investors  have  reliable  and  timely 
information about the level of trading interest in financial instruments. Information on 
certain types of transactions such as the transfer of financial instruments as collateral 
would  not  provide  meaningful  information  to  investors  in  respect  of  the  level  of 
genuine trading interest in a financial instrument. Requiring investment firms to make 
public  those  transactions  would  cause  significant  operational  challenges  and  costs 
without  improving  the  price  formation  process.  Therefore,  post-trade  transparency 
obligations  in  respect  of  transactions  executed  outside  a  trading  venue  should  only 
apply in the case of a purchase or sale of a share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or 
other similar financial instrument. It is essential that certain transactions such as those 
involving  the  use  of  any  such  instruments  for  collateral  lending  or  other  purposes 
where  the  exchange  is  determined  by  factors  other  than  the  current  market  valuation 
should not be published as they do not contribute to the price discovery process, would 
only blur the picture for investors and be a hindrance to achieving best execution.  

(15)

  Pursuant  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014,  transactions  executed  on  a  trading  venue 
should be made public by  market  operators and investment  firms  operating a trading 
venue.  In  respect  of  transactions  executed  outside  the  rules  of  a  trading  venue,  it  is 
essential  to  clarify  which  investment  firm  should  make  public  a  transaction  in  cases 
where both parties to the transaction are investment firms established in the Union to 
ensure 
the 

transactions  without  duplication.  Therefore, 

the  publication  of 

EN 

8 

EN 

 

 

 

responsibility to make a transaction public should always fall on the selling investment 
firm  unless  only  one  of  the  counterparties  is  a  systematic  internaliser  and  it  is  the 
buying firm. 

(16)

  Where only one of the  counterparties is a systematic internaliser in  a  given financial 
instrument and it is also  the buying firm for that instrument, it should be responsible 
for making the transaction public as its clients would expect it to do so and it is better 
placed to fill in the reporting field mentioning its status of systematic internaliser. To 
ensure  that  a  transaction  is  only  published  once,  the  systematic  internaliser  should 
inform the other party that it is making the transaction public. 

(17)

 

It is important to maintain current standards for the publication of transactions carried 
out as back-to-back trades to avoid the publication of a single transaction as multiple 
trades  and  to  provide  legal  certainty  on  which  investment  firm  is  responsible  for 
publishing a transaction. Therefore, two matching trades entered at the same time and 
for  the  same  price  with  a  single  party  interposed  should  be  published  as  a  single 
transaction. 

(18)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation  should  apply  from  the  same  date.  However,  to  ensure  that  the  new 
transparency regulatory regime can operate effectively from 3 January 2017, and that 
market  participants  have  sufficient  time  to  implement  the  new  requirements  by  that 
date, it is necessary for certain transitional provisions to apply from the date of entry 
into force of this Regulation. These transitional provisions should enable the collection 
of data for the calculations and provide for an earlier publication of the most relevant 
markets  in  terms  of  liquidity,  the  sizes  of  orders  that  are  large  in  scale,  the  deferred 
publication thresholds and standard market sizes. 

(19)

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.  

(20)

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group

Parliament and of the Council3,

Size of orders which are large in scale 

1.  An  order  in  respect  of  a  share,  depositary  receipt,  certificate  or  other  similar  financial 
instrument  shall be considered to  be large in  scale compared with  normal  market  size if, on

2.  An  order  in  respect  of  an  ETF  shall  be  considered  to  be  large  in  scale  compared  with

the  waiver  from  the  obligation  referred  to  in  Article  3(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014 
shall  continue  to  apply  in  respect  of  an  order  that  is  large  in  scale  compared  with  normal 
market size when entered into an order book but that, following partial execution, falls below

estimate and publish the average daily turnover for that financial instrument. In doing so, the

the  total  turnover  for  a  particular  financial  instrument  as  specified  in  Article  17(4)  by  the 
number  of  trading  days  in  the  period  considered  on  the  most  relevant  market  in  terms  of 
liquidity for that financial instrument as determined in accordance with Article 4.

Annex I: Information to be made public  

Table 1 

Description of the type of trading systems and the related information to be made public 

in accordance with Article 3 

Type of trading system 

Description of the trading system 

Continuous auction order 
book trading system 

A system that by means of an order book 
and a trading algorithm operated without 
human intervention matches sell orders 
with buy orders on the basis of the best 
available price on a continuous basis. 

Quote-driven trading 
system 

A system where transactions are 
concluded on the basis of firm quotes 
that are continuously made available to 
participants, which requires the market 
makers to maintain quotes in a size that 
balances the needs of members and 
participants to deal in a commercial size 
and the risk to which the market maker 
exposes itself. 

Periodic auction trading 
system 

A system that matches orders on the 
basis of a periodic auction and a trading 
algorithm operated without human 
intervention. 

Request for quote trading 
system 

A trading system where a quote or quotes 
are provided in response to a request for 
quote submitted by one or more 
members or participants. The quote is 
executable exclusively by the requesting 
member or participant. The requesting 
member or participant may conclude a 
transaction by accepting the quote or 
quotes provided to it on request. 

Information to be made public 
The aggregate number of orders and the 
shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, 
certificates and other similar financial 
instruments that they represent at each 
price level for at least the five best bid 
and offer price levels. 
The best bid and offer by price of each 
market maker in shares, depositary 
receipts, ETFs, certificates and other 
similar financial instruments traded on 
the trading system, together with the 
volumes attaching to those prices. 
The quotes made public shall be those 
that represent binding commitments to 
buy and sell the financial instruments 
and which indicate the price and 
volume of financial instruments in 
which the registered market makers are 
prepared to buy or sell. In exceptional 
market conditions, however, indicative 
or one-way prices may be allowed for a 
limited time.  
The price at which the auction trading 
system would best satisfy its trading 
algorithm in respect of shares, 
depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates 
and other similar financial instruments 
traded on the trading system and the 
volume that would potentially be 
executable at that price by participants 
in that system. 

The quotes and the attached volumes 
from any member or participant which, 
if accepted, would lead to a transaction 
under the system’s rules. All submitted 
quotes in response to a request for 
quote may be published at the same 
time but not later than when they 
become executable. 

EN 

25 

EN 

 

 

 

Any other trading system 

Any other type of trading system, 
including a hybrid system falling into 
two or more of the types of trading 
systems referred to in this table. 

 

 

 

Adequate information as to the level of 
orders or quotes and of trading interest 
in respect of shares, depositary receipts, 
ETFs, certificates and other similar 
financial instruments traded on the 
trading system; in particular, the five 
best bid and offer price levels and/or 
two-way quotes of each market maker 
in that instrument, if the characteristics 
of the price discovery mechanism so 
permit.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No  648/20121,  and  in  particular  Article  1(8),  Article  9(5),  Article  11(4),  Article  21(5)  and 
Article 22(4) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

A  high  degree  of  transparency  is  essential  to  ensure  that  investors  are  adequately 
informed  as  to  the  true  level  of  actual  and  potential  transactions  in  bonds,  structured 
finance  products,  emission  allowances  and  derivatives  irrespective  of  whether  those 
transactions  take  place  on  regulated  markets,  multilateral  trading  facilities  (MTFs), 
organised  trading  facilities,  systematic  internalisers,  or  outside  those  facilities.  This 
high degree of transparency should also establish a level playing field between trading 
venues so that the price discovery process in respect of particular financial instruments 
is  not  impaired  by  the  fragmentation  of  liquidity,  and  investors  are  not  thereby 
penalised.  

At  the  same  time,  it  is  essential  to  recognise  that  there  may  be  circumstances  where 
exemptions  from  pre-trade  transparency  or  deferrals  of  post-trade  transparency 
obligations should be provided to avoid the impairment of liquidity as an unintended 
consequence  of  obligations  to  disclose  transactions  and  thereby  to  make  public  risk 
positions. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify the precise circumstances under which 
waivers  from  pre-trade  transparency  and  deferrals  from  post-trade  transparency  may 
be granted.

The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  specifying 
the  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency  requirements  that  apply  to  trading  in  non-
equity  financial  instruments.  To  ensure  coherence  between  those  provisions,  which 
should  enter  into  force  at  the  same  time,  and  to  facilitate  a  comprehensive  view  for 
stakeholders  and,  in  particular,  those  subject  to  the  obligations  it  is  necessary  to 
include these regulatory technical standards in a single Regulation. 

(4)

  Where  competent  authorities  grant  waivers  in  relation  to  pre-trade  transparency 
requirements  or  authorise  the  deferral  of  post-trade  transparency  obligations,  they 
should  treat  all  regulated  markets,  multilateral  trading  facilities,  organised  trading 
facilities and investment firms trading outside of trading venues equally and in a non-
discriminatory manner.

It  is  appropriate  to  provide  for  clarification  of  a  limited  number  of  technical  terms. 
Those  technical  definitions  are  necessary  to  ensure  the  uniform  application  in  the 
Union  of  the  provisions  contained  in  this  Regulation  and,  hence,  contribute  to  the 
establishment of a single rulebook for Union financial markets. Those definitions are 
purely  functional  for the purpose of setting  out  the transparency obligations for non-
equity  financial  instruments  and  should  be  strictly  limited  to  understanding  this 
Regulation.  

Exchange-traded-commodities  (ETCs)  and  exchange-traded  notes  (ETNs)  subject  to 
this Regulation  should be considered as debt  instruments  due to  their legal  structure. 
However,  since  they  are  traded  in  a  similar  fashion  to  ETFs  a  similar  transparency 
regime as that of ETFs should be applied.  

In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, a number of instruments should be 
considered to be eligible for a pre-trade transparency waiver for instruments for which 
there  is  not  a  liquid  market.  This  includes  in  particular  derivatives  subject  to  the 
clearing obligation but for which ESMA has determined that they shall not be subject 
to the trading obligation as well as bonds, derivatives, structured finance products and 
emission allowances which are not liquid. 

A  trading  venue  operating  a  request  for  quote  (RFQ)  system  should  at  least  make 
public  all  the  firm  bid  and  offer  prices  or  actionable  indications  of  interest  and  the 
depth  attached  to  those  prices  no  later  than  at  the  time  when  the  requester  is  able  to 
execute  a  transaction  under  the  system’s  rules.  This  is  to  ensure  that  members  or 
participants  who  are  providing  their  quotes  to  the  requester  first  are  not  put  at  a 
disadvantage.   

The  majority  of  liquid  covered  bonds  are  mortgage  bonds  issued  to  grant  loans  for 
financing  private  individuals’  purchase  of  a  home  and  the  average  value  of  which  is 
directly related to the value of the loan. In this market, liquidity providers ensure that 
professional investors trading in large sizes are matched with home owners trading in 
small  sizes.  To  avoid  disruption  of  this  function  and  contingent  detrimental 

EN 

41 

EN 

 

 

 

(10)

 

(11)

 

consequences  for  home  owners,  the  size  specific  to  the  instrument  above  which 
liquidity providers may benefit from a pre-trade transparency waiver should be set at a 
the  trade  size  below  which  lie  40  percent  of  the  transactions  since  this  trade  size  is 
deemed reflective of the average price of a home.  

Information  which  is  required  to  be  made  available  as  close  to  real  time  as  possible 
should  be  made  available  as  instantaneously  as  technically  possible,  assuming  a 
reasonable level of efficiency and of expenditure on systems on the part of the person 
concerned.  The  information  should  only  be  published  close  to  the  prescribed 
maximum time limit in exceptional cases where the systems available do not allow for 
a publication in a shorter period of time. 

Investment  firms  should  make  public  the  details  of  transactions  executed  outside  a 
trading venue through an Approved Publication Arrangement (APA). This Regulation 
should set out the way investment firms report their transactions to APAs and should 
apply  in  conjunction  with  Regulation  (EU)  XXX  on  [RTS  13  on  DRSP]  where  the 
specific requirements applicable to APAs are specified. 

(12)

  Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provides for the possibility to specify the application of 
the  obligation  of  post-trade  disclosure  of  transactions  executed  between  two 
investment  firms,  including  systematic  internalisers,  in  bonds,  structured  finance 
products,  emission allowances and derivatives which are determined by factors other 
than  the  current  market  valuation,  such  as  the  transfer  of  financial  instruments  as 
collateral. Since such transactions do not contribute to the price discovery process, risk 
to  blur  the  picture  for  investors  and  hinder  achieving  best  execution,  this  Regulation 
specifies the transactions determined by factors other than the current market valuation 
which should not be made public. 

(13)

 

Investment firms often conduct, on own account or on behalf of clients, transactions in 
derivatives and other financial instruments or assets that are composed by a number of 
interlinked, contingent trades. Such package transactions enable investment firms and 
their  clients  to  better  manage  their  risks  with  the  price  of  each  component  of  the 
package  transaction  reflecting  the  overall  risk  profile  of  the  package  rather  than  the 
prevailing  market  price  of  each  component.  Package  transactions  can  take  various 
forms, such as exchange for physicals, trading strategies executed on trading venues or 
bespoke  package  transactions  and  it  is  important  to  take  those  specificities  into 
account  when  calibrating  the  applicable  transparency  regime.  It  is  therefore 
appropriate to  specify for the purpose of this Regulation   the conditions for applying 
deferrals  from  post-trade  transparency  to  package  transactions.  Such  arrangements 
should not be available for transactions which hedge financial instruments conducted 
in the normal course of the business. 

(14)

  Exchange  for  physicals  are  an  integral  part  of  financial  markets,  allowing  market 
participants  to  organise  and  execute  exchange-traded  derivatives  transactions  which 
are linked directly to a transaction in the underlying physical market. They are widely 

EN 

42 

EN 

 

 

 

(15)

used and they involve a multitude of actors, such as farmers, producers, manufacturers 
and  processors  of  commodities.  Typically  an  exchange  for  physical  transaction  will 
take  place  when  a  seller  of  a  physical  asset  seeks  to  close  out  his  corresponding 
hedging position in a derivative contract with the buyer of the physical asset, when the 
latter  happens  to  also  hold  a  corresponding  hedge  in  the  same  derivative  contract. 
They  therefore  facilitate  the  efficient  closing  out  of  hedging  positions  which  are  not 
necessary anymore.   

  Pursuant  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014,  transactions  executed  on  a  trading  venue 
should be made public by  market  operators and investment  firms  operating a trading 
venue.  In respect  of transactions concluded outside the  rules of a trading venue, it is 
essential  to  clarify  which  investment  firm  should  make  public  a  transaction  in  cases 
where both parties to the transaction are investment firms established in the Union to 
ensure 
the 
responsibility to make a transaction public should always fall on the selling investment 
firm  unless  only  one  of  the  counterparties  is  a  systematic  internaliser  and  it  is  the 
buying firm. 

transactions  without  duplication.  Therefore, 

the  publication  of 

(16)

  Where only one of the  counterparties is a systematic internaliser in  a  given financial 
instrument and it is also the buying firm for that instrument, it should be responsible 
for making the transaction public as its clients would expect it to do so and it is better 
placed to fill in the reporting field mentioning its status of systematic internaliser. To 
ensure  that  a  transaction  is  only  published  once,  the  systematic  internaliser  should 
inform the other party that it is making the transaction public.  

(17)

 

It is important to maintain current standards for the publication of transactions carried 
out  as  back-to-back  trades  to  avoid  the  publication  of  a  single  transaction  as  various 
trades  and  to  provide  legal  certainty  on  which  investment  firm  is  responsible  for 
publishing a transaction. Therefore, two matching trades entered at the same time and 
for  the  same  price  with  a  single  party  interposed  should  be  published  as  a  single 
transaction.  

(18)

  Regulation  (EU)  600/2014  allows  competent  authorities  to  require  the  publication  of 
supplementary  details  when  publishing  information  benefitting  from  a  deferral,  or  to 
allow  deferrals  for  an  extended  time  period.  In  order  to  contribute  to  the  uniform 
application of these provisions across the Union, it is necessary to frame the condition 
and  criteria  under  which  supplementary  deferrals  may  be  allowed  by  competent 
authorities.  

(19)

  Trading  in  many  non-equity  financial  instruments,  and  in  particular  derivatives,  is 
episodic,  variable  and  subject  to  regular  modifications  of  trading  patterns.  Static 
determinations of financial instruments which do not have a liquid market and of the 
various thresholds for the purpose of calibrating pre-trade and post-trade transparency 
obligations  without  providing  for  the  possibility  to  adapt  the  liquidity  status  and  the 
thresholds in light of changes in trading patterns would therefore not be suitable. It is 

EN 

43 

EN 

 

 

 

(20)

 

appropriate to set out the methodology and parameters which are necessary to perform 
the liquidity assessment and the calculation of the thresholds for the application of pre-
trade transparency waivers and deferral of post-trade transparency on a periodic basis.  

In order to ensure consistent application of the waivers to pre-trade transparency and 
the post-trade deferrals it is necessary to create uniform rules regarding the content and 
frequency of data  competent authorities may request  from  trading venues, APAs and 
Consolidated  Tape  Providers  (CTPs)  for  transparency  purposes  as  well  as  the 
methodology  for  calculating  the  respective  thresholds  and  for  publishing  the 
information  across the Union.  Rules on the specific methodology and data necessary 
to  perform  calculations  for  the  purpose  of  specifying  the  transparency  regime 
applicable  to  non-equity  financial  instruments  should  be  applied  in  conjunction  with 
Regulation (EU) No [RTS 3 on Article 22 and DVC] which specifies in more general 
terms, the common elements with regard to the content and frequency of data requests 
to  be  addressed  to  trading  venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  for  the  purposes  of  transparency 
and other calculations. 

(21)

  For  bonds,  except  ETCs  and  ETNs,  transactions  below  EUR  100,000  should  be 
excluded from the calculations of pre-trade and post-trade transparency thresholds, as 
those are considered to be of a retail size in accordance with Article 3(2) of Directive 
2003/71/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 2 .  Those  retail-sized 
transactions  should  in  all  cases  benefit  from  the  new  transparency  regime  and  any 
threshold giving rise to a waiver or deferral from transparency should be set above that 
level.  

(22)

  The  purpose  of  the  exemption  from  transparency  obligations  set  out  in  Regulation 
(EU)  No  600/2014  is  to  ensure  that  the  effectiveness  of  operations  conducted  by  the 
Eurosystem  in  the  performance  of  primary  tasks  as  set  out  in  the  Statute  of  the 
European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank annexed to the 
Treaty on the European Union (the Statute), and under equivalent national provisions 
for  members  of  the  European  System  of  Central  Banks  (ESCB)  in  Member  States 
whose  currency  is  not  the  euro,  which  relies  on  the  timeliness  and  confidentiality  of 
transactions,  should  not  be  compromised  by  disclosure  of  information  on  such 
transactions. It is crucial for central banks to be able to control whether, when and how 
information about their actions is disclosed so as to maximise the intended impact and 
limit  any  unintended  impact  on  the  market.  Therefore,  legal  certainty  should  be 
provided  for  the  members  of  the  ESCB  and  their  respective  counterparties  as  to  the 
scope of the exemption from transparency requirements. 

                                                 

2 Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 on the prospectus to 
be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and amending Directive 2001/34/EC 
(OJ L 345, 31.12.2003, p. 64).

  One  of  the  primary  ESCB  tasks  under  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  EU 
(TFEU) and the Statute  and under  equivalent  national provisions for members of the 
ESCB  in  Member  States  whose  currency  is  not  the  euro,  appears  to  be  the 
performance of foreign exchange policy, which entails holding and managing foreign 
reserves  to  ensure  that,  whenever  needed,  there  is  a  sufficient  amount  of  liquid 
resources  available  for  its  foreign  exchange  policy  operations.  The  application  of 
transparency  requirements  to  foreign  reserve  management  operations  may  result  in 
unintended  signals  to  the  market,  which  could  interfere  with  the  foreign  exchange 
policy  of  the  Eurosystem  and  of  members  of  the  ESCB  in  Member  States  whose 
currency  is  not  the  euro.  Similar  considerations  may  also  apply  to  foreign  reserve 
management operations in the performance of monetary and financial stability policy 
on a case-by-case basis. 

(24)

  The exemption from transparency obligations for transactions where the counterparty 
is a member of the ESCB should not apply in respect of transactions entered into by 
any member of the ESCB in performance of their investment operations. This should 
include  operations  conducted  for  administrative  purposes  or  for  the  staff  of  the 
member  of  the  ESCB,  including  transactions  conducted  in  the  capacity  as  an 
administrator of a pension scheme in accordance with Article 24 of the Statute. 

(25)

  The  temporary  suspension  of  liquidity  obligations  should  only  be  imposed  in 
exceptional  situations which represent  a significant  decline in  liquidity across a class 
of financial instruments  based on objective and measurable factors. It is  necessary to 
differentiate  between  classes  initially  determined  as  having  or  not  having  a  liquid 
market as a further significant decline in relative terms in a class already determined as 
illiquid  is  likely  to  occur  more  easily.  Therefore,  a  suspension  of  transparency 
requirements  in  instruments  determined  as  not  having  a  liquid  market  should  be 
imposed only if a decline by a higher relative threshold has occurred. 

(26)

  This  Regulation  should  ensure  that  the  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency  regime 
established by Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 is appropriately calibrated to the market 
and is applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union. It is therefore essential that 
this Regulation lays down the necessary calculations to be performed, including their 
periods and methods. In this respect, to avoid market distorting effects, the calculation 
periods  specified  in  this  Regulation  should  ensure  that  the  relevant  thresholds  of  the 
regime  are  updated  at  appropriate  intervals  to  reflect  market  conditions.  It  is  also 
appropriate to provide for the centralised publication of the results of the calculations 
so  that  they  are  made  available  to  all  financial  market  participants  and  competent 
authorities in  the Union in  a single place and in a user-friendly manner. To that end, 
competent authorities should notify ESMA of the results of their calculations and then 
ESMA should publish those calculations on its website.  

(27)

  For  the  purpose  of  the  transparency  calculations,  reference  data  is  necessary  as  to 
determine  unequivocally  to  which  sub-asset  class  each  financial  instrument  belongs. 
Therefore, this Regulation requires trading venues to provide additional reference data 

EN 

45 

EN 

 

 

 

to  that  established  by  Regulation  (EU)  No.  xx/xxxx  [RTS  on  Art  27  MiFIR  – 
Reference data]. 

(28)

  For  the  purpose  of  the  determination  of  the  sub-classes  of  financial  instruments  not 
having a liquid market for the asset-class of foreign exchange derivatives, the lack of 
data allowing a comprehensive analysis of the entire market permitted the definition of 
the qualitative liquidity criteria to be considered for the segmentation of the asset class 
but  prevented  the  determination  of  the  liquidity  thresholds.  As  a  result,  until  data  of 
better  quality  is  available,  the  asset  class  of  foreign  exchange  derivatives  should  be 
considered not to have a liquid market. 

(29)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation  should  apply  from  the  same  date.  However,  to  ensure  that  the  new 
transparency regulatory regime can operate effectively from 3 January 2017, and that 
market  participants  have  sufficient  time  to  implement  the  new  requirements  by  that 
date, it is necessary for certain transitional provisions to apply from the date of entry 
into force of this Regulation. These transitional provisions should enable the collection 
of data on a best effort basis for the transparency purposes and provide for an earlier 
publication  of  instruments  or  classes  of  instruments  for  which  there  is  not  a  liquid 
market  and  of  the  thresholds  for  pre-trade  waivers  and  deferrals  to  post-trade 
transparency.

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

(31)

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group

Post-trade transparency obligations 

1. 
Investment  firms  trading  outside  the  rules  of  a  trading  venue  and  market  operators  and 
investment firms operating a trading venue shall make public by reference to each transaction 
the details set out in Tables 1 and 2 of Annex II and use each applicable flag listed in Table 3 
of Annex II.  

2.  Where a previously published trade report is cancelled, investment firms trading outside a 
trading  venue  and  market  operators  and  investment  firms  operating  a  trading  venue  shall 
make public a new trade report which contains all the details of the original trade report and 
the cancellation flag as specified in Table 3 of Annex II. 

3.  Where a previously published trade report is amended, investment firms trading outside a 
trading  venue  and  market  operators  and  investment  firms  operating  a  trading  venue  shall 
make the following information public: 

(a)  a  new  trade  report  that  contains  all  the  details  of  the  original  trade  report  and  the 

cancellation flag as specified in Table 3 of Annex II; 

(b)  a  new  trade  report  that  contains  all  the  details  of  the  original  trade  report  with  all 
necessary details corrected and the amendment flag as specified in Table 3 of Annex II. 

4.  Post-trade  information  shall  be  made  available  as  close  to  real  time  as  is  technically

buying firm, only that firm shall make the transaction public through an APA, informing the 
seller of the action taken.  

7. 
Investment  firms  shall  take  all  reasonable  steps  to  ensure  that  the  transaction  is  made 
public as a single transaction. For that purpose, two matching trades entered at the same time 
and  for  the  same  price  with  a  single  party  interposed  shall  be  considered  to  be  a  single 
transaction.

transactions  in  financial  instruments  that  are  above  the  size  specific  to  the 
instrument as specified in Article 10.

transaction on an individual basis shall be published unless an extended or an indefinite time 
period of deferral is granted in accordance with Article 11.

the purposes of determining the applicable deferral regime shall be the competent authority of 
the  investment  firm  responsible  for  making  the  trade  public  through  an  APA  in  accordance

The obligation to make public the volume and price of transactions and the time at which they

defined  in  advance  by  that  trading  venue  for  the  respective  sub-class  or  sub-asset  class. 
Market  operators  and  investment  firms  operating  a  trading  venue  may  maintain  such  trade 
sizes  until  application  of  the  results  of  the  next  calculations  performed  in  accordance  to 
paragraph 17.

normal market size referred to in Articles 3 and 8(1)(a) have been published and which belong 
to one of the sub-asset classes specified in paragraph 1(a)(ii), the size specific to the financial 
instrument and the size of orders and transactions large in scale compared with normal market 
size shall be those applicable to the smallest average daily notional amount (ADNA) band of 
the sub-asset class to which the equity derivative belongs.

provided in response to a request for a quote 
submitted by one or more other members or 
participants. The quote is executable exclusively by 
the requesting member or market participant. The 
requesting member or participant may conclude a 
transaction by accepting the quote or quotes 
provided to it on request. 

A trading system where transactions between 
members are arranged through voice negotiation. 

Trading system not covered by 
first 5 rows 

A hybrid system falling into two or more of the 
first five rows or a system where the price 
determination process is of a different nature than 
that applicable to the types of system covered by 
first five rows. 

For each financial instrument, the best bid and 
offer by price of each market maker in that 
instrument, together with the volumes attaching 
to those prices. 
The quotes made public shall be those that 
represent binding commitments to buy and sell 
the financial instruments and which indicate the 
price and volume of financial instruments in 
which the registered market makers are prepared 
to buy or sell. In exceptional market conditions, 
however, indicative or one-way prices may be 
allowed for a limited time. 

For each financial instrument, the price at which 
the auction trading system would best satisfy its 
trading algorithm and the volume that would 
potentially be executable at that price by 
participants in that system. 

The quotes and the attaching volumes from any 
member or participant which, if accepted, would 
lead to a transaction under the system’s rules. All 
submitted quotes in response to a request for 
quote may be published at the same time but not 
later than when they become executable. 
 

The bids and offers and the attaching volumes 
from any member or participant which, if 
accepted, would lead to a transaction under the 
system’s rules 

Adequate information as to the level of orders or 
quotes and of trading interest; in particular, the 
five best bid and offer price levels and/or two-
way quotes of each market maker in the 
instrument, if the characteristics of the price 
discovery mechanism so permit.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU)

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  requires  competent  authorities  and  the  European 
Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  to  perform  a  significant  number  of 
calculations  in  order  to  calibrate  the  applicability  of  the  pre-trade  and  post-  trade 
transparency regime and the trading obligation for derivatives as well as to determine 
whether an investment firm is a systematic internaliser.  

In order to perform the necessary calculations, both competent authorities and ESMA 
need  to  be  able  to  obtain  robust  and  high  quality  data  for  each  asset  class  to  which 
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 applies. The provisions in this Regulation will improve 
both  the  accessibility  and  the  quality  of  data  available  to  competent  authorities  and 
ESMA  in  accordance  with  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of 
the  Council  of  15  May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending 
Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU2  and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 
so  that  the  classification  of  financial  instruments,  including  the  thresholds  for  the 
purposes  of  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency,  and,  where  necessary,  re-
calibrations of these thresholds, can be calculated on a more informed basis after the 
regime has been applied for a certain period of time.

  With the exception of potential ad-hoc data requests and calculations to be performed 
for the purposes of the Volume cap mechanism, this Regulation should require trading 
venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  to  submit  reports  on  a  daily  basis.  Considering  the  broad 
scope of financial instruments covered and the large amount of data to be processed, 
this daily submission enables competent authorities to more accurately process files of 
manageable  sizes  and  ensures  an  efficient  and  timely  management  of  the  data 
submission,  data  quality  check  and  data  processing.  Collecting  data  on  a  daily  basis 
also  simplifies  the  data  provision  obligation  on  trading  venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  by 
alleviating them from the burden of calculating the number of trading days in the cases 
where that quantitative liquidity criterion is applicable, and of aggregating data for the 
same financial instrument across different time maturity buckets in the cases where the 
time  to  maturity  has  to  be  considered.  Centralising  that  calculation  also  ensures  a 
consistent use of the criteria across financial instruments and trading venues.

Trading  venues  should  store  data  that  is  comprehensive  and  allows  competent 
authorities  and  ESMA  to  perform  accurate  calculations.  While  the  required 
information  is  usually  provided  in  the  post-trade  reports,  in  some  cases,  the 
information  necessary  for  the  calculations  goes  beyond  the  information  available  in 
those reports. This includes, for example, information on transactions executed on the 
basis of orders that benefitted from the large in scale waiver. This information should 
not  be  included  in  trade  reports  since  it  could  expose  such  transactions  to  adverse 
market  impact.  However,  since  that  information  might  be  necessary  for  competent 
authorities  to  perform  accurate  calculations,  it  should  be  stored  appropriately  by 
trading  venues  and  CTPs  and  communicated  to  competent  authorities  and  ESMA 
where  necessary.  Trading  venues  should  ensure  that  they  adequately  disseminate  the 
information to be provided to competent authorities and ESMA. Transactions executed 
on the basis of large in scale orders should be appropriately identified in their report to 
CTPs.

Data  should  be  collected  from  a  variety  of  sources  since  a  single  source  may  not 
always  hold  a  complete  data  set  for  an  asset  class  or  even  a  particular  instrument. 
Therefore,  to  allow  competent  authorities  and  ESMA  to  obtain  and  consolidate  high 
quality data from various sources, trading venues, APAs and CTPs should use, where 
available,  pre-set  specifications  in  terms  of  content  and  format  in  order  to  make  the 
data  collection  easier  and  more  cost  efficient.  This  should  also  facilitate  the 
automation  to  the  extent  possible  of  any  future  re-classifications  of  financial 
instruments and any recalibrations of thresholds.  

Considering the sensitivity of the necessary calculations and the potential commercial 
consequences  for  trading  venues,  issuers  and  other  market  participants  of  publishing 
incorrect information which could lead, in the case of the volume cap mechanism, to 
the suspension of the use of the waivers for one particular venue or across the Union 
for one particular financial instrument, it is crucial to clarify the format of the data to 
be  submitted  to  competent  authorities  and  ESMA  in  order  to  set  up  efficient 
communication channels with trading venues and CTPs and ensure timely and correct 
publication of the required data. 

Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires ESMA to publish, for financial instruments to 
which  the  volume  cap  mechanism  applies,  measurements  of  the  total  volume  of 
trading  in  the  previous  12  months  and  of  the  percentages  of  trading  under  both  the 
negotiated  trade  and  reference  price  waivers  across  the  Union  and  on  each  trading 
venue in the previous 12 months. In case of financial instruments traded in more than 
one  currency,  it  is  hence  necessary  to  convert  the  volumes  executed  in  different 
currencies  into  one  common  currency  so  as  to  enable  the  computation  of  those 
volumes and make the required calculations. Therefore, this Regulation should set out 
the  methodology  and  exchange  rates  to  be  used  to  convert,  where  necessary,  trading 
volumes.  

For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, this Regulation requires trading venues 
to  report  the  volumes  of  trading  executed  under  the  reference  price  waiver  and,  for 
liquid instruments, the negotiated trade waiver. Given that the waivers apply to orders 
and not to transactions, it is important to clarify that the volumes to be reported should 
include all transactions flagged with  “RFPT” or “NLIQ” for the purpose of the post-
trade publication of transactions and as specified in Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU)  No  xx/xxxx[Transparency  for  equity  and  equity-like  instruments].  Where  a 
transaction was executed on the basis of two orders benefitting from the large in scale 
waiver,  this  transaction  should  not  count  towards  the  volumes  calculated  under  the 
reference price waiver and the negotiated trade waiver. 

(10)

  For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues and CTPs should ensure 
that  the  trading  venue  on  which  the  transaction  was  executed  is  identified  with 
sufficient  granularity  to  allow  ESMA  to  perform  all  calculations  set  out  under 
Regulation  (EU) No 600/2014.  In particular, the  trading venue identifier used should 
be unique for that trading venue and not shared with any other trading venue operated 

EN 

176 

EN 

 

 

 

(11)

by  the  same  market  operator.  Trading  venue  identifiers  should  allow  ESMA  to 
distinguish in an unequivocal manner all trading venues for which the market operator 
has received a specific authorisation under Directive 2014/65/EU.  

  Under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the period for which trading under the reference 
price  waiver  and,  for  liquid  financial  instruments,  negotiated  transaction  waiver  is  to 
be monitored starts on 3 January 2016. To this end, it is necessary to establish in this 
Regulation  a provision requiring trading venues  to  submit a first  report on 3 January 
2017 with trading volumes for the year 2016. To ensure a proportionate application of 
this  requirement,  trading  venues  should,  for  that  purpose,  base  their  report  on  the 
adjusted  volumes  of  trading  executed  under  equivalent  waivers  existing  under 
Directive  2004/39/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 3  and 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/20064. 

(12)

 

In  order  to  provide  competent  authorities  and  ESMA  with  accurate  data,  trading 
venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  should  ensure  that  their  reports  include  single-counted 
transactions only. 

(13)

  The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  specifying 
the content, frequency, format of data requests, the method to be used to process  this 
data and other specifications relating to the publication of information for the purposes 
of transparency as defined under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. To ensure coherence 
between those provisions, which will enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate 
a  comprehensive  view  for  stakeholders,  and  in  particular  those  subject  to  the 
obligations,  it  is  desirable  to  include  these  regulatory  technical  standards  in  a  single 
Regulation.

1.  For  each  financial  instrument  subject  to  the  transparency  requirements  in  Article  3  of 
Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014,  trading  venues  shall  submit  to  the  competent  authority  the 
following data: 

(a)  the total volume of trading in the financial instrument executed on that trading venue;  

(b)  the total volumes of trading in the financial instrument executed on that trading venue 
falling under the waivers of Article 4(1)(a) or Article 4(1)(b)(i) of Regulation (EU) No 
600/2014 respectively with total volumes reported separately for each waiver.   

2.  For  each  financial  instrument  subject  to  the  transparency  requirements  in  Article  3  of 
Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  and  where  requested  by  the  competent  authority,  CTPs  shall 
submit to the competent authority the following data: 

EN 

180 

EN 

 

 

 

(a)  the total volumes of trading in the financial instrument executed on all trading venues in  

the Union with total volumes reported separately for each trading venue; 

(b)  the  total  volumes  of  trading  executed  on  all  trading  venues  in  the  Union falling  under 
the waivers of Article 4(1)(a) or 4(1)(b)(i) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 respectively 
with total volumes reported separately for each waiver and for each trading venue.   

3.  Trading  venues  and  CTPs  shall  report  the  data  set  out  in  paragraphs  1  and  2  using  the 
formats  provided  in  the  Annex.  They  shall,  in  particular,  ensure  that  the  trading  venue 
identifiers they provide are sufficiently granular to enable the competent authority and ESMA 
to  identify  the  volumes  of  trading  executed  under  the  reference  price  waiver  and,  for  liquid 
financial instruments, under the negotiated trade waiver of each trading venue and allow for 
the calculation of the ratio set out under Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. 

4.  For the purposes of the calculation of the volumes referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: 

(a)  the volume of an individual transaction shall be determined by multiplying the price of 

the financial instrument by the number of units traded;  

(b)  the total  volume of trading  in  each  financial instrument  set  out  in  paragraphs 1(a) and 
2(a) shall be determined by aggregating the volume of all individual and single-counted 
transactions for that financial instrument.  

(c)  the  trading  volumes  set  out  in  paragraphs  1(b)  and  2(b)  shall  be  determined  by 
aggregating the volumes of individual and single-counted transactions for that financial 
instrument  reported  under  the  flags  “reference  price”  and  “negotiated  transactions  in 
liquid  financial  instruments”  in  accordance  with  Table  4  of  Annex  I  of  Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) No xx/xxxx [Equity transparency]. 

5.  Trading  venues  and  CTPs  shall  only  aggregate  transactions  executed  in  the  same 
currency  and  shall  report  separately  each  aggregated  volume  in  the  currency  used  for  the 
transactions. 

6.  Trading venues shall submit the data referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 on the first and the 
sixteenth day of each calender month byt 13:00 CET to the competent authority. If the first or 
the  sixteenth  day  of  the  calendar  month  is  a  non-working  day  for  the  trading  venue,  the 
trading venue shall report the data to the competent authority by 13:00 CET on the following 
working day.  

7.  Trading venues shall submit the total volume determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 
to 5 and executed in respect of the following time periods: 

(a)  for  the  reports  to  be  submitted  on  the  sixteenth  day  of  each  calendar  month,  the 

execution period is from the first day to the fifteenth day of the same calendar month; 

EN 

181 

EN 

 

 

 

(b)  for  the  reports  to  be  submitted  on  the  first  day  of  each  calendar  month,  the  execution 

period is from the sixteenth day to the last day of the previous calendar month. 

8.  By way of derogation to paragraphs 6 and 7, trading venues shall submit the first  report 
per  financial  instrument  on  3  January  2017  by  13:00  CET  and  shall  include  the  trading 
volumes  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  from  3  January  2016  to  31  December  2016.  For  this 
purpose, trading venues shall report separately, for each calendar month: 

(a)  the  trading  volumes  during  the  period  from  the  first  day  to  the  fifteenth  day  of  each 

calendar month;   

(b)  the  trading  volumes  during  the  period  from  the  sixteenth  day  to  the  last  day  of  each 

calendar month.  

9.  Trading venues and CTPs shall respond to any ad hoc request from competent authorities 
on the volume of trading in relation to the calculation to be performed for monitoring the use 
of  the  reference  price  or  negotiated  trade  waivers  by  close  of  business  on  the  next  working 
day following the request.

3.  Where  a  financial  instrument  is  traded  in  more  than  one  currency  across  the  Union, 
ESMA  shall  convert  all  volumes  into  EUR  using  average  exchange  rates  calculated  on  the 
basis  of  the  daily  euro  foreign  exchange  reference  rates  published  by  the  European  Central 
Bank on its website in the previous 12 months. Those converted volumes shall be used for the 
calculation  and  publication  of  the  total  volume  of  trading  and  of  the  percentages  of  trading 
under  both  the  negotiated  trade  and  reference  price  waivers  across  the  Union  and  on  each

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/20121, and in particular Article 32(6) thereof, 

 

Whereas:

(2)

 

This Regulation contributes to the specification of the criteria for the determination of 
sufficient third-party buying and selling interest in a class of derivatives or a relevant 
subset  of  a  class  of  derivatives.  Where  European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority 
(ESMA)  has  established  that  a  class  of  derivatives  should  be  subject  to  the  clearing 
obligation under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council2 and  that  they  are  admitted  to  trading  or  traded  on  a  trading  venue,  ESMA 
should  follow  the  criteria  in  this  Regulation  to  determine  whether  the  derivatives  or 
subset thereof is considered sufficiently liquid to trade exclusively on trading venues. 

Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 sets out that derivatives are considered to  be executed 
on an OTC basis when they are not traded on, or not subject to the rules of, a regulated 
market  whereas  the  definition  of  derivatives  executed  on  an  over-the-counter  (OTC) 
under  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 3  is 
narrower,  comprising  derivatives  not  traded  on,  or  not  subject  to  the  rules  of,  a 
regulated  market,  multilateral  trading  facility  (MTF)  or  organised  trading  facility

2  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  4  July  2012  on  OTC 
derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p.1) 
3 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial

(OTF). ESMA should therefore assess the extent to which trades are executed already 
on trading venues in a class of derivatives or a relevant subset thereof and compare to 
the level of trading not executed on a trading venue. The prevalence of trading outside 
a trading venue should not, however, automatically establish that a class of derivatives 
or  a  relevant  subset  thereof  is  not  suitable  for  the  trading  obligation.  ESMA  should 
have  regard  also  to  the  anticipated  impact  of  the  trading  obligation  considering  both 
the  possibility 
increased 
transparency  and  availability  of  the  financial  instruments,  as  well  as  the  potential 
negative consequences of such decision.  

liquidity  and  market 

to  promote 

integrity 

through 

Given  the  similarity  of  the  definition  of  liquid  market  for  non-equities  under  Article 
2(17)(a)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  to  the  criteria  for  determining  whether  a 
class of derivatives or subset thereof is  sufficiently liquid  under Article  32(3) of that 
Regulation, the assessment undertaken for one should be taken into consideration for 
the  other  to  promote  consistency  of  treatment  of  instruments.  However,  a  class  of 
derivatives or subset thereof deemed to have a liquid market for transparency purposes 
should not be deemed automatically to be sufficiently liquid for the trading obligation. 
The quantitative thresholds and qualitative weightings may differ, taking into account 
the different objectives of the assessments. 

Given the wide range of instruments potentially affected by the trading obligation for 
derivatives  and  their  specific  characteristics,  the  constant  evolution  of  financial 
markets and the variety of national markets involved it is not possible to determine for 
each and every derivative type an exhaustive list specifying the elements relevant to an 
assessment  of  third-party  buying  and  selling  interest  or  the  weighting  to  be  given  to 
any particular element.  

However,  a  degree  of  clarity  should  be  provided  for  the  determination  of  a  class  of 
derivatives or relevant subset thereof which is sufficiently liquid, in particular, through 
specifying  the  criteria  with  respect  to  average  frequency  of  trades,  average  size  of 
trades,  number  and  type  of  active  market  participants  and  average  size  of  spreads 
which together indicate the level of third-party buying and selling interest.  

The  observation  period  for  determining  whether  a  class  of  derivatives  or  relevant 
subset thereof is sufficiently liquid to trade exclusively on trading venues should vary 
depending on the class of derivatives or relevant subset thereof concerned. It should be 
sufficiently long to ensure that the data collected is not skewed by any type of events 
that  may  cause  unusual  trading  patterns.  In  any  circumstance  the  observation  period 
should not be shorter than three months.   

The criteria described in this Regulation should be designed so that the assessment of 
one  derivative  or  classes  of  derivatives  may  be  compared  with  other  derivatives  or 
classes  of  derivatives  with  similar  characteristics.  The  identification  of  classes  of 
derivatives with similar characteristics may include a number of elements such as the 
currency  in  which  they  are  traded,  maturity  dates,  the  starting  term  of  the  contracts

(10)

tenor, whether they follow a standard convention or not, and whether they are on-the-
run contracts.  

ESMA  should  refer  to  historical  data  indicating  shifts  in  liquidity  to  determine  both 
whether the class of derivatives or subset thereof is sufficiently liquid to trade only on 
venues  and  whether  it  is  only  sufficiently  liquid  in  transactions  below  a  certain  size. 
The  thresholds  for  these  assessments  may  vary  between  classes  of  derivatives  or 
subsets thereof where the characteristics and the notional size of the classes or subsets 
vary. In its assessment of spreads, ESMA should have regard to both the average size 
and  the  availability  of  spreads,  balancing  the  consideration  that  a  lack  of,  or  wide, 
spreads indicates insufficient liquidity against the possibility that spreads may become 
narrower through increased transparency  and  availability of the financial instruments 
if the trading obligation is introduced. 

In its assessment, ESMA should remove  from  its  calculations those trades which  are 
clearly  identifiable  as  post-trade  risk  reduction  trades  which  reduce  non-market  risks 
in derivatives portfolios. To include such transactions in the assessment for the trading 
obligation may otherwise result in  an inflated view of the level  of third level  buying 
and selling interest. 

  ESMA  should  also  take  into  consideration  the  need  or  otherwise  to  permit  package 
transactions  during  its  assessment.  Investment  firms  often  conduct,  on  their  own 
account  or  on  behalf  of  clients,  transactions  in  derivatives  and  other  financial 
instruments that comprise a number of interlinked trades which are contingent on one 
another.  Given  package  transactions  enable  investment  firms  and  their  clients  to 
manage their risks and improve the resiliency of financial markets, it may be desirable 
to continue to permit the execution of some package transactions which comprise one 
or  more  derivatives  subject  to  the  trading  obligation  to  be  executed,  on  a  bilateral 
basis, outside a trading venue. 

(11)

  Criteria  should  also  be  set  out  to  enable  ESMA  to  determine  whether  an  existing 
trading  obligation  for  a  class  of  derivatives  or  a  relevant  subset  thereof  should  be 
amended,  suspended  or  revoked,  unless    the  class  of  derivatives  or  a  relevant  subset 
thereof is no longer traded on at least one trading venue.  

(12)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date.

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

ESMA to the Commission.

standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and

Sufficient third party buying and selling interest 

1.  When establishing whether a class of derivatives or relevant subset thereof has sufficient 
third-party  buying  and  selling  interest  to  be  considered  sufficiently  liquid  for  the  trading 
obligation, ESMA shall apply the criteria in Article 32(3) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, as

In  relation  to  the  average  frequency  of  trades,  ESMA  shall  take  into  consideration  the 

1. 
following elements: 

(a)  the number of days on which trading took place;  

(b)  the number of trades.  

2.  ESMA’s analysis of the criteria in paragraph 1 shall take into account the distribution of 
trading executed on trading venues and executed OTC. ESMA shall assess these criteria over 
a  period  of  time  of  sufficient  length  to  determine  whether  the  liquidity  of  each  class  of 
derivatives or a relevant subset thereof is subject to seasonal or structural factors. ESMA shall 
also consider whether trades are concentrated at certain points in time and over certain sizes 
over  the  period  assessed  and  determine  to  what  extent  such  concentration  constitutes 
predictable patterns.

divided by the number of trades. 

2.  ESMA’s  analysis  of  the  criteria  in  paragraph  1  shall  take  into  account  the  factors 
specified in Article 2(2).

In  relation  to  the  number  and  type  of  active  market  participants,  ESMA  shall  take  into 

1. 
consideration the following elements:  

(a)  the  total  number  of  market  participants  trading  in  that  class  of  derivatives  or  relevant 

subset thereof is not lower than two;  

(b)  the  number  of  trading  venues  that  have  admitted  to  trading  or  are  trading  the  class  of

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments, and in particular Article 28(5) 
thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  sets  out  a  formal  regulatory  procedure  for  mandating 
trading in derivatives that have been considered to be clearing-eligible and which are 
sufficiently liquid to take place on a range of trading venues.  

To  ensure  that  goal  is  effectively  achieved,  Article  28(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014  prescribes  that  the  trading  obligation  shall  also  apply  to  third-country 
entities that would be subject to the clearing obligation if they were established in the 
Union,  which  enter  into  derivatives  transactions  pertaining  to  a  class  of  derivatives 
that has been declared subject to the trading obligation, provided that the contract has a 
direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the Union or where such obligation is 
necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of such Regulation. 

Given  the  broad  variety  of  over-the-counter  (OTC)  derivative  contracts,  in  order  to 
determine  when  an  OTC  derivative  contract  may  be  considered  to  have  a  direct, 
substantial and foreseeable effect within the Union and cases where it is necessary or 
appropriate to prevent the evasion of rules and obligations arising from any provision 
of  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  the  Council 1  a 
criteria-based approach should be adopted. 

                                                 

1  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  4  July  2012  on  OTC 
derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 1)

Given that pursuant to Article 33(3) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the provisions 
of that Regulation would be deemed fulfilled when at least one of the counterparties is 
established in  a country  for which the Commission  has adopted an implementing act 
declaring  equivalence  in  accordance  with  Article  33(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014,  these  regulatory  technical  standards  should  apply  to  contracts  where  both 
counterparties  are  established  in  a  third  country  whose  legal,  supervisory  and 
enforcement arrangements  have not  yet  been declared equivalent to  the  requirements 
laid down in that Regulation. 

Certain  information  on  contracts  concluded  by  third  country  entities  would  still  only 
be  available  to  third  country  competent  authorities.  Therefore  Union  competent 
authorities should closely  cooperate with  those  authorities in  order to  ensure that the 
relevant provisions are applied and enforced. 

Given  the  intrinsic  relationship  between  these  technical  standards  and  Commission 
Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  285/2014,  of  13  February  2014,  supplementing 
Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 with regard to regulatory technical standards on direct, 
substantial  and  foreseeable  effect  of  contracts  within  the  Union  and  to  prevent  the 
evasion  of  rules  and  obligations,  the  technical  terms  necessary  for  a  comprehensive 
understanding of the technical standards should be defined in the same way. 

OTC derivative contracts concluded by entities established in third countries covered 
by a guarantee provided by entities established in the Union create a financial risk for 
the guarantor established in the Union. Furthermore, given that the risk would depend 
on the size of the guarantee granted by financial counterparties in order to cover OTC 
derivative  contracts  and  given  the  interconnections  between  financial  counterparties 
compared to non-financial counterparties, only OTC derivative contracts concluded by 
entities  established  in  third  countries  that  are  covered  by  a  guarantee  which  exceeds 
certain  quantitative thresholds and is  provided by financial counterparties established 
in the Union should be considered as having a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect 
in the Union. 

Financial  counterparties  established  in  third  countries  can  enter  into  OTC  derivative 
contracts  through  their  Union  branches.  Given  the  impact  of  the  activity  of  those 
branches  on  the  Union  market,  OTC  derivative  contracts  concluded  between  those 
Union  branches  should  be  considered  to  have  a  direct,  substantial  and  foreseeable 
effect within the Union. 

OTC  derivative  contracts  that  are  entered  into  by  specific  counterparties  with  the 
primary  purpose  of  avoiding  the  application  of  the  clearing  obligation  or  of  the  risk 
mitigation  techniques  applicable  to  entities  that  would  have  been  the  natural 
counterparties  to  the  contract,  should  be  considered  as  evading  the  rules  and 
obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as they hinder the achievement 
of a purpose of that Regulation, namely mitigating counterparty credit risk.

(11)

  OTC derivative contracts that are part of an arrangement whose characteristics are not 
supported by a business  rationale or commercial substance and have  as their primary 
purpose  the  circumvention  of  the  application  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014, 
including  rules  relating  to  the  conditions  of  an  exemption,  should  be  considered  as 
evading the rules and obligations laid down in that Regulation. 

  Situations  where  the  individual  components  of  the  arrangement  are  inconsistent  with 
the  legal  substance  of  the  arrangement  as  a  whole,  where  the  arrangement  is  carried 
out  in  a  manner  which  would  not  ordinarily  be  used  in  what  is  expected  to  be 
reasonable  business  conduct,  where  the  arrangement  or  series  of  arrangements 
includes  elements  that  have  the  effect  of  offsetting  or  nullifying  their  reciprocal 
economic substance, where transactions are circular in nature, should be considered as 
indicators of an artificial arrangement or an artificial series of arrangements. 

(12)

 

It  is  desirable  to  provide  technical  standards  related  to  contracts  that  have  a  direct, 
substantial  and  foreseeable  effect  within  the  Union  as  well  as  technical  standards 
related to the prevention of evasion of rules and obligations provided for in Regulation 
(EU)  No  600/2014  in  a  single  instrument  since  both  relate  to  the  trading  obligation. 
Furthermore, they share common features such as their application to a contract whose 
counterparties  would  not  be  subject  to  the  trading  obligation  if  the  conditions  of 
Article 28 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 specified further by this Regulation were 
not met. 

(13)

  Given  that  third  country  entities  affected  by  these  regulatory  technical  standards 
require  time  in  order  to  arrange  for  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Regulation 
(EU) No 600/2014 when their OTC derivative contracts fulfil the conditions set out in 
these regulatory technical standards for being considered to have a direct,  substantial 
and foreseeable effect within the Union, it is appropriate to delay the application of the 
provision containing those conditions by six months.

‘guarantee’  means  an  explicitly  documented  legal  obligation  by  a  guarantor  to  cover 
payments of the amounts due or that may become due pursuant to the OTC derivative 
contracts covered by that guarantee and entered into by the guaranteed entity in favour 
of  the  beneficiary  where  there  is  a  default  as  defined  in  the  guarantee  or  where  no 
payment has been effected by the guaranteed entity. 

 

Article 2 

Contracts with a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the Union 

1.  An  OTC  derivative  contract  shall  be  considered  as  having  a  direct,  substantial  and 
foreseeable  effect  within  the  Union  when  at  least  one  third  country  entity  benefits  from  a 
guarantee  provided  by  a  financial  counterparty  established  in  the  Union  which  covers  all  or 
part of its liability resulting from that OTC derivative contract, to the extent that the guarantee 
meets both following conditions:  

(a)  it  covers  the  entire  liability  of  a  third  country  entity  resulting  from  one  or  more  OTC 
derivative contracts for an aggregated notional amount of at least  EUR 8 billion or the 
equivalent  amount  in  the  relevant  foreign  currency,  or  it  covers  only  a  part  of  the 
liability of a third country  entity resulting  from  one or more OTC derivative contracts 
for an aggregated notional amount of at least EUR 8 billion or the equivalent amount in 
the relevant foreign currency divided by the percentage of the liability covered; 

(b)  it is at least equal to 5 per cent of the sum of current exposures, as defined in Article 272 
(17)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/20133,  in  OTC  derivative  contracts  of  the  financial 
counterparty established in the Union issuing the guarantee.  

                                                 

2    Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  24  November  2010 
establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision 
No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

When the guarantee is issued for a maximum amount which is below the threshold set out in 
point  (a)  of  the  first  sub-paragraph,  the  contracts  covered  by  that  guarantee  shall  not  be 
considered  to  have  a  direct,  substantial  and  foreseeable  effect  within  the  Union  unless  the 
amount  of  the  guarantee  is  increased,  in  which  case  the  direct,  substantial  and  foreseeable 
effect  of  the  contracts  within  the  Union  shall  be  re-assessed  by  the  guarantor  against  the 
conditions set out in points (a) and (b) of the first sub-paragraph on the day of the increase.  

Where  the  liability  resulting  from  one  or  more  OTC  derivative  contracts  is  below  the 
threshold set out in point (a) of the first sub-paragraph, such contracts shall not be considered 
to have a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the Union even where the maximum 
amount of the  guarantee covering such liability is equal  to  or above the threshold set  out  in 
point  (a)  of  the  first  sub-paragraph  and  even  where  the  condition  set  out  in  point  (b)  of  the 
first sub-paragraph has been met.  

In the event of an increase in the liability resulting from the OTC derivative contracts or of a 
decrease of the current exposure, the guarantor shall re-assess whether the conditions set out 
in  points  (a)  and  (b)  of  the  first  sub-paragraph  are  met.  Such  assessment  shall  be  done 
respectively on the day of the increase of liability for the condition set out in point (a) of the 
first  sub-paragraph,  and  on a monthly basis for the condition  set  out  in  point (b) of the first 
sub-paragraph.  

OTC  derivative  contracts  for  an  aggregate  notional  amount  of  at  least  EUR  8  billion  or  the 
equivalent amount in the relevant foreign currency concluded before a guarantee is issued or 
increased, and subsequently covered by a guarantee that meets the conditions set out in points 
(a) and (b) of the first  sub-paragraph, shall be considered as having a direct,  substantial  and 
foreseeable effect within the Union.  

2.  An  OTC  derivative  contract  shall  be  considered  as  having  a  direct,  substantial  and 
foreseeable effect within the Union where the two entities established in a third country enter 
into  the  OTC  derivative  contract  through  their  branches  in  the  Union  and  would  qualify  as 
financial counterparties if they were established in the Union. 

 

Article 3  

Cases where it is necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of rules or obligations 

provided for in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 

1.  An  OTC  derivative  contract  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  designed  to  circumvent  the 
application  of  any  provision  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  if  the  way  in  which  that

2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  1,  a  contract  shall  be  considered  as  having  for  primary 
purpose the avoidance of the application of any provision of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 if 
the  primary  purpose  of  an  arrangement  or  series  of  arrangements  related  to  the  OTC 
derivative  contract  is  to  defeat  the  object,  spirit  and  purpose  of  any  provision  of  Regulation 
(EU)  No  600/2014  that  would  otherwise  apply  including  when  it  is  part  of  an  artificial 
arrangement or artificial series of arrangements.  

3.  An  arrangement  that  intrinsically  lacks  business  rationale,  commercial  substance  or 
relevant  economic  justification  and  consists  of  any  contract,  transaction,  scheme,  action, 
operation, agreement, grant, understanding, promise, undertaking or event shall be considered 
an artificial arrangement. The arrangement may comprise more than one step or part.

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May 2014 on markets in financial instruments amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 
2011/61/EU1 , and in particular points (a) and (d) of Article 17(7) thereof. 

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

It is important to adopt  detailed regulatory technical standards to  ensure that systems 
and risk controls used by investment  firms engaged in algorithmic trading, providing 
direct electronic access and acting as general clearing members are efficient, resilient 
and  have  an  adequate  capacity  in  a  manner  appropriate  to  the  nature,  scale  and 
complexity  of  their  business  model.  It  is  also  important  to  set  out  the  content  and 
format of the forms to be used by investment firms engaged in high frequency trading 
for submitting to competent authorities the records of their orders upon request and the 
length of time that these records must be kept.  

These regulatory technical standards should address all risks that may affect the core 
elements  of  a  trading  system,  including  the  hardware,  software  and  associated 
communication  lines  which  investment  firms  use  to  perform  their  trading  activities 
and  should  cover  any  type  of  execution  systems  or  order  management  systems 
operated by investment firms.  

To ensure proper calibration of the obligations provided in these regulatory technical 
standards,  it  is  necessary  to  differentiate  trading  algorithms  that  are  investment 
decision algorithms  from order execution algorithms.  Investment  decision algorithms 
make  automated  trading  decisions  by  determining  which  assets  to  purchase  or  sell.

Order  execution  algorithms  optimise  order-execution  processes  by  automatic 
generation and submission of orders or quotes, to one or several trading venues once 
the investment decision has been taken.  

The  potential  impact  that  algorithms  may  have  on  the  overall  fair  and  orderly 
functioning  of  the  market  should  constitute  a  guiding  principle  in  setting  out 
regulatory technical standards regarding the testing of algorithms. In this regard, only 
those  pure  investment  decision  algorithms  which  generate  orders  that  are  only  to  be 
executed  by  non-automated  means  and  with  human  intervention  should  be  excluded 
from the testing requirements.  

Reference  should  be  made  to  elements  which  are  instrumental  for  the  resilience  and 
capacity  of  investment  firms  engaged  in  algorithmic  trading  including  staffing  and 
outsourcing policies. 

Investment firms should be required to segregate tasks and functions at various levels 
so as to reduce their dependency on a single person or unit.  

Investment firms should operate a kill functionality enabling them to withdraw all or a 
subset  of  their  orders  where  this  becomes  necessary.  For  such  a  functionality  to  be 
effective, investment firms should always be in a position to know which algorithms, 
traders or clients are responsible for an order.  

These  regulatory  technical  standards  should  apply  jointly  with  other  regulatory 
requirements  stemming  from  Directives  2005/60/EC2,  2014/65/EU3and  2013/36/EU4 
of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council5. 

Investment  firms  providing  direct  electronic  access  (DEA)  services  should  always 
retain responsibility for the trading that their DEA clients carry out under their name. 
Responsibility  for  those  services  should  constitute  the  key  factor  governing  the 
framework  for  pre-trade  and  post-trade  controls  and  for  assessing  the  suitability  of 
prospective DEA clients. Investment firms should therefore have sufficient knowledge 
about  the  intentions,  capabilities,  financial  resources  and  trustworthiness  of  their

clients, including information about the prospective DEA clients’ disciplinary history 
with competent authorities and trading venues, where publicly available. 

Investment  firms  which  provide  DEA  services  (“DEA  provider”)  may  provide  those 
services to clients without being engaged in algorithmic trading themselves. However, 
since the clients may use the DEA to engage in algorithmic trading, it is necessary to 
ensure  that  the  DEA  providers  have  the  proper  systems  and  controls  in  place  and  be 
subject  to  the  organisational  requirements  provided  in  these  regulatory  technical 
standards.  

(11)

  The  specific  organisational  requirements  for  investment  firms  must  be  determined 
according to a robust self-assessment where, at a minimum, the parameters set out in 
this  Regulation  must  be  assessed.  That  self-assessment  should  include  any  other 
circumstances not included in that list that might have an impact on their organisation, 
thus constituting one of the cornerstones of the supervision of investment firms carried 
out by the competent authorities. 

(12)

  Self-assessments should be undertaken periodically by investment firms to gain a full 
understanding of the trading systems and algorithms they use and the risks stemming 
from  algorithmic  trading.  An  investment  firm’s  understanding  should  be  irrespective 
of whether the systems  and algorithms were developed by the investment  firm  itself, 
purchased from a third party, designed or developed in close cooperation with a client 
or a third party. 

(13)

 

Investment  firms  engaged  in  algorithmic  trading  should  monitor  that  their  trading 
systems cannot be used for any purpose that is contrary to Regulation (EU) 596/2014 
of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council6 or  to  the  rules  of  a  trading  venue  to 
which they are connected. Where monitoring leads to the  identification of suspicious 
transactions  or  orders,  the  submission  of  the  reports  to  the  competent  authorities 
should take place in accordance with the requirements and the format set out in Article 
16 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.  

(14)

  Conformance testing should be relied upon to establish that the trading systems of an 
investment  firm  communicate  and  interact  properly  with  the  trading  systems  of  the 
trading  venue  or  direct  market  access  (DMA)  provider  and  that  market  data  is  being 
processed correctly.  

(15)

  Controlled  deployment  of  algorithms  should  be  observed  by  investment  firms  when 
introducing  all  algorithms  regardless  of  whether  they  are  new  or  previously 
successfully  deployed  in  another  trading  venue  or  that  their  architecture  has  been 

                                                 

6 Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse 
(market abuse regulation) and repealing Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and 
Commission Directives 2003/124/EC, 2003/125/EC and 2004/72/EC;  

EN 

203 

EN 

 

 

 

materially  modified.  The  controlled  deployment  of  algorithms  should  ensure  that  the 
algorithms perform as expected in a live environment by setting cautious limits on the 
number of  financial instruments being  traded, the price, value  and number of orders, 
the  strategy  positions  and  the  number  of  markets  involved  and  by  monitoring  the 
activity of the algorithm more intensively. 

(16)

  The  generation  of  alerts  following  real  time  monitoring  should  be  done  as  close  to 
instantaneously as technically possible. Any actions following that monitoring should 
be  undertaken  as  soon  as  possible  assuming  a  reasonable  level  of  efficiency  and 
expenditure of the persons and systems concerned.  

(17)

  Due diligence of prospective DEA clients should be adapted to the risks posed by the 
nature, scale and complexity of their expected trading activities, and the service being 
provided. In particular, it should include an assessment of the expected level of trading 
and order volume and the type of connection offered to the relevant trading venues.  

(18)

  Different  types  of  risks  should  be  addressed  by  different  types  of  controls.  Pre-trade 
controls  should  be  conducted  before  an  order  is  submitted  to  a  trading  venue. 
Investment  firms  should  also  monitor  their  trading  activity  and  implement  real-time 
alerts  which  identify  signs  of  disorderly  trading  or  a  breach  of  their  pre-trade  limits. 
Post-trade  controls  should  be  put  in  place  to  at  least  monitor  the  market  and  credit 
risks  of  the  investment  firm  through  post-trade  reconciliation.  In  addition,  potential 
market  abuse  or  breach  with  rules  of  trading  venues  should  be  prevented  through 
specific  surveillance  systems  generating  alerts  on  the  following  day  at  the  latest, 
having been calibrated to minimise false positive and false negative alerts.  

(19)

  To  ensure  consistency  with  the  general  order  record-keeping  obligations  for 
investment firms under Article 25(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the time limits 
of  the  order  record  keeping  obligation  for  investment  firm  engaging  in  a  high-
frequency algorithmic trading technique should be aligned with ones prescribed under 
Article 25(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.  

(20)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  as  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date.

Article 5  

(Article 17(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

General methodology 

1.  Prior  to  the  initial  deployment  or  substantial  update  of  an  algorithmic  trading  system, 
trading  algorithm  or  algorithmic  trading  strategy,  investment  firms  shall  set  up  clearly 
delineated development and testing methodologies. 

2.  A responsible party designated by senior management of the investment firm shall sign-
off  the  initial  deployment  or  substantial  update  of  an  algorithmic  trading  system,  trading 
algorithm or algorithmic trading strategy. 

3.  The development and testing methodologies shall address the design and performance of 
the system, algorithm  or strategy, the division  of responsibilities, the allocation of sufficient 
resources, escalation procedures, recordkeeping and approval.

4.  The development and testing methodologies and scenarios shall ensure that: 

(a)  the  algorithmic  trading  system,  trading  algorithm  or  algorithmic  trading  strategy  does 

not behave in an unintended manner;  

(b)  the operation of the algorithmic trading system, trading algorithm or algorithmic trading 
strategy 
investment  firm’s  obligations  under  Directive 
2014/65/EU and in particular, that embedded compliance and risk management control 
functions as intended;  

is  compliant  with 

the 

(c)  the trading systems, trading algorithms or trading strategies conform with the rules and 

systems of the trading venues accessed;  

(d)  the  trading  system,  trading  algorithm  or  trading  strategy  does  not  contribute  to 
disorderly  trading  conditions,  and  can  continue  to  work  effectively  in  stressed  market 
conditions,  and  where  necessary  under  those  conditions,  allows  the  trading  system  or 
algorithm to be switched off. 

5. 
Investment  firms  shall  adapt  their  testing  methodologies  to  the  trading  venues  and 
markets  where  the  algorithms  will  be  deployed.  Investment  firms  shall  undertake  further 
testing  if  there  are  substantial  changes  to  the  trading  system  or  the  access  to  the  venue  in 
which the algorithmic trading system, trading algorithm  or algorithmic trading strategy is  to 
be used. 

6.  Paragraphs 2 to 5 shall only apply to algorithms leading to order execution with limited 
or no human intervention.  

Investment  firms  shall  keep  records  of  any  material  changes  made  to  the  software  used 

7. 
for algorithmic trading, allowing them to accurately determine: 

(a)  when a change was made; 

(b)  who made the change; 

(c)  who approved the change; 

(d)  the nature of the change. 

 

Article 6 

(Article 17(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Conformance testing 

1. 

Investment firms shall test the conformance of their trading systems and algorithms with: 

(a) 

the trading venue in any of the following cases: 

EN 

208 

EN 

 

 

 

(i)  when accessing the venue as a member; 

(ii)  when  connecting  to  the  venue  through  a  sponsored  access  arrangement  for  the 

first time;  

(iii) when there is a material change of the systems of the trading venue; 

(iv) prior  to  the  initial  deployment  or  material  update  of  an  algorithmic  trading 

system, trading algorithm or algorithmic trading strategy. 

(b)  the DMA provider in any of the following cases:  

(i)  when  they  access  the  trading  venue  through  a  DMA  arrangement  for  the  first 

time; 

(ii)  when there is a material change affecting the DMAfunctionality of the provider;  

(iii) prior  to  the  initial  deployment  or  material  update  of  an  algorithmic  trading 

system, trading algorithm or algorithmic trading strategy. 

2.  Conformance testing shall ensure that the basic elements of the system or the algorithm 
operate  correctly  and  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  trading  venue  or  the  DMA 
provider, including the ability of the algorithm to interact as expected with the trading venue’s 
matching logic, and adequately process the data flows downloaded from the trading venue. 

 

Article 7 

(Article 17(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Testing environments 

1. 
Investment  firms  shall  ensure  that  testing  under  Article  5(4)(a),  (b)  and  (d)  shall  be 
undertaken in non-live environments, segregated from their production environments, that are 
used specifically for the testing and development of trading algorithms and trading systems. 

For  the  purposes  of  the  first  subparagraph,  the  production  environment  shall  include  the 
environments  where  algorithmic  trading  systems  effectively  operate  and  comprise  software 
and  hardware  used  by  traders,  order  routing  to  trading  venues,  market  data,  dependent 
databases, risk control systems, data capture and analysis systems, and post-trade processing 
systems. 

2. 
Investment  firms  may  fulfil  the  testing  requirements  under  Article  5(4)(a),  (b)  and  (d) 
using their own testing environment, or a testing environment as provided by a trading venue, 
a DEA provider, or a vendor.

Annual self-assessment and validation of systems 

1. 
Investment  firms  shall  perform  an  annual  self-assessment  and  validation  process  to 
elaborate  a  validation  report.  Investment  firms  shall  review  and  evaluate  their  algorithmic 
trading  systems  and  trading  algorithms,  their  governance,  accountability  and  sign-off 
framework  and  relevant  business  continuity  and  their  overall  compliance  with  Article  17  of 
Directive 2014/65/EU, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of their business. 
The self-assessment shall include an analysis of at least all the parameters set out in Annex I 
to this Regulation. 

2.  The risk management control function of the investment firm shall be responsible for the 
creation  of  the  validation  report,  and  shall  involve  staff  with  the  necessary  technical 
knowledge.  Compliance  function  shall  be  made  aware  of  any  issues  identified  in  the 
validation reports. The validation reports shall be audited by the firm’s internal audit function, 
where such function exists. 

3.  The validation reports shall be approved by the investment firm’s senior management. 

Investment  firms  shall  act  on  the  basis  of  the  review  processes  and  validation  reports

Stress testing 

As  part  of  their  annual  self-assessment  referred  to  in  Article  9,  investment  firms  shall  test 
their algorithmic trading systems  and related procedures and controls to  ensure that they are 
capable  of  withstanding  increased  order  flows  or  market  stresses.  Investment  firms  shall 
design  such  tests  to  be  specific  to  the  nature  of  their  trading  activity  and  to  their  trading 
systems. Investment firms shall ensure that the tests are carried out in such a way that they do 
not impact the production environment. Such tests shall at least consist of the following: 

(a)  running  high  messaging  volume  tests  using  at  least  twice  the  highest  volume  of 

messaging received and sent by the firm over the previous six month period;  

(b)  running  high  trade  volume  tests  using  at  least  twice  the  highest  volume  of  trading 

reached by the firm over the previous six month period.

Kill functionality 

1. 
Investment  firms  shall  be  in  the  position  to  know  which  algorithm  and  which  trader, 
trading  desk or, where  applicable, client  is  responsible for each order that  is  being sent  to  a 
trading  venue  and  shall  have  the  ability,  as  an  emergency  measure,  to  cancel  unexecuted 
orders submitted to  individual trading venues originated by individual traders, trading desks 
or, where applicable, clients. 

EN

cancel all the firm’s outstanding orders at all trading venues to which the firm is connected.  

 

Article 13  

(Article 17(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Prevention and identification of potential market abuse or breaches  

1. 
Investment  firms  shall monitor  all  trading  activity  that  takes  place  through  their  trading 
systems,  including  that  of  their  clients,  for  signs  of  potential  market  abuse  as  specified  in 
Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.  

2. 
In addition to the obligations contained in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 596/EU/2014 as 
specified by [Article XX of Regulation on regulatory technical standards for the appropriate 
arrangements,  systems  and  procedures  as  well  as  notification  templates  to  be  used  for 
preventing,  detecting  and  reporting  abusive  practices  or  suspicious  orders  or  transactions], 
investment  firms  shall  establish  and  maintain  surveillance  systems  that  are  automated  and 
adapted to the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s trading activity to conduct effective 
monitoring  of  orders  and  transactions,  generating  alerts  and  reports  and,  where  appropriate, 
employing  visualisation  tools.  The  surveillance  system  shall  cover  the  full  range  of  trading 
activities  undertaken  by  the  investment  firms  and  all  orders  submitted  by  those  firms. 
Investment firms shall cross-check any indications of suspicious trading activity generated by 
their  surveillance  systems  during  the  investigation  phase  against  other  relevant  trading 
activities undertaken by those firms. 

3. 
Investment  firms’  surveillance  system  shall  be  adaptable  to  changes  to  their  regulatory 
obligations and their trading behaviour, including changes to the firm’s own trading strategy 
or that of its clients, the type and volume of instruments traded, the size and complexity of its 
order flow, and the markets accessed.  

4.  The surveillance system shall be subject to review at least once a year, in order to assess 
whether the system itself and the parameters and filters that it employs are still adequate to the 
firm’s  regulatory  obligations  and  its  trading  behaviour,  including  the  minimisation  of  false 
positive and false negative surveillance alerts generated by the surveillance system.  

5.  Using  a sufficiently detailed level  of time  granularity, the investment  firms’ monitoring 
systems  shall  be  able  to  read,  replay  and  analyse  order  and  transaction  data  on  an  ex-post 
basis,  with  sufficient  capacity  to  be  able  to  operate  in  an  automated  low-latency  trading 
environment  where  relevant,  and  generate  operable  alerts  at  the  beginning  of  the  following 
trading day or, only in cases where manual processes are involved, at the end of the following 
trading day. In order to ensure adequate documentation and follow-up to alerts generated by 
the  surveillance  system,  the  system  shall  be  used  in  parallel  with  a  workflow  creation  and 
management system.

6.  Staff  responsible  for  monitoring  the  firm’s  trading  activities  for  the  purposes  of  the 
previous paragraphs shall report any trading  activity which may be not  compliant with  their 
firm’s  policies  and  procedures  or  with  the  firm’s  regulatory  obligations  to  the  compliance 
function to assess that information and take any appropriate actions, including reporting to the 
trading  venue  or  submitting  a  suspicious  transaction  or  order  report  in  accordance  with 
Regulation  (EU)  No  596/2014  for  the  appropriate  arrangements,  systems  and  procedures  as 
well  as  notification  templates  to  be  used  for  preventing,  detecting  and  reporting  abusive 
practices or suspicious orders or transactions. 

7. 
Investment  firms  shall  maintain  accurate,  complete,  and  consistent  trade  and  account 
information  by  reconciling  as  soon  as  practicable  their  own  electronic  trading  logs  with 
records  provided  by  trading  venues,  their  brokers,  clearing  members,  central  counterparties 
(CCPs), data providers, or other relevant business partners, as applicable and as appropriate to 
the nature, scale and complexity of the business.

Business continuity arrangements  

1. 
Investment  firms  shall  have  business  continuity  arrangements  in  place  with  respect  to 
their algorithmic trading systems which are appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of 
their  business.  Those  arrangements  shall  be  documented  in  writing  or  any  other  durable 
medium.  

2.  Business  continuity  arrangements  of  investment  firms  shall  effectively  deal  with 
disruptive  incidents  and,  where  appropriate,  ensure  a  timely  resumption  of  algorithmic 
trading. The arrangements shall cover at least the following:  

(a)  governance for the development and deployment of the arrangements; 

(b)  a range of possible adverse scenarios relating to the operation of the algorithmic trading 
systems including at least unavailability of systems, staff, work space, external suppliers 
or dependencies and critical data and documents through loss or alteration;  

(c)  procedures  for  relocating  to,  and  operating  the  trading  system  from  a  back-up  site, 
where  having  such  a  site  is  appropriate  to  the  nature,  scale  and  complexity  of  the 
algorithmic trading activities of the investment firm;  

(d)  staff training on the operation of the arrangements and individuals’ roles;  

(e)  arrangements that are bespoke to each of the venues accessed;  

(f)  usage policy regarding the firm’s kill functionality;

appropriate;  

(h)  alternative  arrangements  for  the  investment  firm  to  manage  outstanding  orders  and 

positions; 

3. 
Investment firms shall ensure that their trading algorithm or trading system are shut down 
in  application  of  their  business  continuity  arrangements  without  creating  disorderly  trading 
conditions.  

Investment  firms  shall  review  and  test  their  business  continuity  arrangements  on  an 

4. 
annual basis and modify the arrangements in light of the review.  

 

Article 15  

(Article 17(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Pre-trade controls on order entry 

Investment firms shall have in place the following pre-trade controls on order entry with 

1. 
respect to all financial instruments, reinforced by appropriate continuous post-trade controls:  

(a)  price  collars  which  automatically  block  or  cancel  orders  that  do  not  meet  set  price 
parameters, differentiating between different financial instruments, both on an order-by-
order basis and over a specified period of time;  

(b)  maximum  order  value,  which  prevents  orders  with  an  uncommonly  large  order  value 

from entering the order book; 

(c)  maximum  order  volume  which  prevents  orders  with  an  uncommonly  large  order  size 

from entering the order book; 

(d)  maximum messages limit which prevents sending an excessive number of messages to 

order books pertaining to the submission, modification or cancellation of an order.  

2. 
Investment  firms  shall  have  in  place,  repeated  automated  execution  throttles  which 
control  the  number  of  times  a  strategy  was  already  applied.  After  a  configurable  number  of 
repeated executions, the system shall be disabled until re-enabled by a designated member of 
staff. 

Investment  firms  shall  immediately  include  all  orders  sent  to  a  trading  venue  into  their 

3. 
pre-trade limit calculation system. 

4. 
Investment  firms  shall  establish  and  enforce  pre-trade  risk  limits  that  are  appropriately 
calibrated for the their capital base, clearing arrangements, trading strategy, risk tolerance and 
experience,  including  variables  such  as  length  of  time  since  engaged  in  algorithmic  trading 

EN 

214 

EN 

 

 

 

and  its  reliance  on  third  party  vendors.  Investment  firms  shall  re-calibrate  the  pre-trade 
controls in order to account for the changing impact of the orders on the relevant market due 
to different price and liquidity levels.  

5. 
Investment  firms  shall  be  able  to  automatically  block  or  cancel  orders  from  a  trader  if 
they  are  aware  that  a  trader  does  not  have  permission  to  trade  a  particular  financial 
instrument. Investment firms shall be able to automatically block or cancel orders where they 
risk  compromising  the  firm’s  own  risk  thresholds.  Controls  shall  be  applied,  where 
appropriate, on exposures to individual clients, financial instruments, traders, trading desks or 
the investment firm as a whole.  

6.  An  investment  firm  shall  have  procedures  and  arrangements  for  dealing  with  orders 
which have been automatically blocked by its pre-trade controls but which the firm wishes to 
submit  upon  authorisation  of  an  empowered  individual  within  the  investment  firm.  Such 
procedures and arrangements shall apply on a temporary and exceptional basis.  

7.  Pre-trade  controls  may  only  be  overridden  in  relation  to  a  specific  trade  with  the  full 
knowledge of relevant staff responsible in the risk management function.  

 

Article 16 

(Article 17(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Real-time monitoring 

1. 
Investment  firms  shall,  during  the  hours  they  are  sending  orders  to  trading  venues, 
monitor  in  real  time  all  algorithmic  trading  activity  that  takes  place  under  their  code, 
including that of their clients, for signs of disorderly trading, including from a cross-market, 
cross-asset class, or cross-product perspective, in cases where the firm or its clients engage in 
such activities.  

2.  Real-time  monitoring  of  algorithms  shall  be  undertaken  by  the  trader  in  charge  of  the 
algorithm and also by an independent risk control function. The risk control function shall be 
considered as independent, regardless of whether the real-time monitoring is conducted by a 
member  of  the  staff  or  by  an  outsourced  function,  provided  that  it  is  not  hierarchically 
dependent  on  the  trader  and  can  offer  appropriate  challenge  as  necessary  within  the 
governance framework. 

3.  Staff  members  in  charge  of  real-time  monitoring  shall  respond  to  operational  and 
regulatory issues in a timely manner, initiating remedial action where necessary. 

4. 
Investment firms shall have procedures in place to ensure that their competent authorities, 
the relevant trading venues and, where applicable, DEA providers, clearing member or CCP 
have  access  to  staff  members  in  charge  of  real-time  monitoring.  Communication  channels 
shall be identified  and tested periodically to  ensure that in  an emergency, the adequate staff 

EN 

215 

EN 

 

 

 

members  with  the  adequate  level  of  authority  may  reach  each  other  in  a  timely  fashion  in 
order  to  ensure  a  fair  and  orderly  market.  In  addition,  contact  procedure  for  out-of-trading 
hours shall also be established.  

5.  Monitoring  systems  shall  have  real-time  alerts  to  assist  staff  in  identifying  any 
unanticipated activities undertaken by an algorithm. Investment firms shall have a process in 
place  to  take  remedial  action  as  soon  as  possible  after  an  alert  is  generated,  including,  as 
necessary,  an  orderly  withdrawal  from  the  market.  These  monitoring  systems  shall  also 
provide alerts in relation to algorithms and DEA orders triggering circuit breakers of a trading 
venue. 

6.  Real-time alerts shall be generated within five seconds of the relevant event.

(Article 17(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU)  

Post-trade controls 

1. 
Investment  firms  shall  continuously  operate  the  post-trade  controls  that  they  have  in 
place.  Where  a  post-trade  control  is  triggered,  the  firm  shall  undertake  appropriate  action 
which  may  include  adjusting  or  shutting  down  the  relevant  trading  algorithm  or  trading 
system or an orderly withdrawal from the market.  

2.  Post-trade controls referred to in paragraph 1 shall include as a minimum the continuous 
assessment  and  monitoring  of  market  and  credit  risk  of  the  investment  firm  in  terms  of 
effective exposure.  

3. 
Investment  firms  shall  maintain  trade  and  account  information  which  is  complete, 
accurate  and  consistent.  Investment  firms  shall  reconcile  their  own  electronic  trading  logs 
with  information  regarding  their  outstanding  orders  and  risk  exposures  as  provided  by  the 
trading venue to which they send orders, their broker or DEA provider, their clearing member 
or CCP, their data providers, or other relevant business partners. Reconciliation shall be made 
in  real  time  where  the  aforementioned  market  participants  provide  the  information  in  real-
time.  Investment  firms  shall  have  the  capability  to  calculate  their  outstanding  exposure  and 
that of their traders and clients in real time.  

4.  For  derivatives,  the  post-trade  controls  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  shall  include  as  a 
minimum, controls regarding the maximum long and short and overall strategy positions, with 
trading limits to be set in units appropriate to the types of instruments involved. 

5.  Post-trade  monitoring  shall  be  undertaken  by  the  relevant  traders  responsible  for  the 
algorithm and one or more risk control functions within the firm.

electronic  security  that  minimise  the  risks  of  attacks  against  their  information  systems. 
Measures shall ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of data, and 
the reliability and robustness of their systems. 

3. 
Investment  firms  shall  promptly  inform  their  competent  authorities  of  any  material 
breaches  in  their  physical  and  electronic  security  measures.  An  incident  report  shall  be 
provided to its competent authority indicating the nature of the incident, the measures adopted 
to cope in an emergency and the initiatives taken to avoid similar incidents from recurring.  

4. 
Investment  firms  shall  undertake  penetration  tests  and  vulnerability  scans  to  safeguard 
against cyber-attacks at least on a yearly basis. They shall implement appropriate safeguards 
against attackers which may include effective identity and access management.  

5. 
Investment firms shall ensure that they are able to identify all persons who have critical 
user  access  rights  to  IT  systems.  Investment  firms  shall  restrict  the  number  of  such  persons 
and shall monitor their access to IT systems to ensure traceability at all times.

EN 

 

 

 

2.  DEA  providers  shall  establish  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  trading  of  DEA 
clients  complies  with  the  trading  venue’s  rules  and  allows  the  DEA  providers  to  meet  the 
requirements applicable to DEA.  

 

Article 20  

(Article 17(5) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Systems and controls of DEA providers  

1.  DEA providers shall apply pre-trade and post-trade controls on the order flow of each of 
their  DEA  clients  as  well  as  real-time  monitoring  and  market  surveillance  controls  in 
accordance with Articles 13, 15, 16 and 17. The controls to be applied by DEA providers shall 
be  separate  and  distinct  from  those  of  DEA  clients.  In  particular,  and  regardless  of  the 
application  by  the  DEA  client  of  its  own  pre-trade  and  post-trade  controls,  real-time 
monitoring  and  market  surveillance  controls,  the  orders  of  DEA  clients  shall  always  pass

DEA client does not have permission to trade. The investment firm must use an internal 
flagging system to identify and to block single clients or a group of clients;  

(d)  automatically  block  or  cancel  orders  of  a  DEA  client  when  they  breach  the  DEA 
provider’s  risk  management  thresholds.  Controls  shall  be  applied  to  exposures  of 
individual clients, financial instruments or groups of clients; 

(e)  stop order flow transmitted by their DEA clients;

trading  desks  and  traders  of  those  clients,  who  submit  orders  through  the  DEA  provider’s 
systems by assigning unique identification code to them.  

4.  Where a DEA provider allows a client to sub-delegate the DEA access it receives to its 
own  clients,  the  DEA  provider  shall  be  able  to  identify  the  different  order  flows  from  the 
beneficiaries of the sub-delegation. For these purposes, it will not be necessary for the DEA 
provider to know the identity of these beneficiaries of the sub-delegation.  

5.  DEA  providers  shall  record  the  relevant  data  relating  to  the  orders  submitted  by  their 
DEA  clients,  including  modifications  and  cancellations,  the  alerts  generated  by  their

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular Article 48(12)(a),(c) and (g) thereof, 

Whereas:

It  is  important  to  adopt  detailed  regulatory  technical  standards  to  ensure  that  trading 
venues that enable algorithmic trading have sufficient systems and controls. 

These  regulatory  technical  standards  should  apply  not  only  to  regulated  markets  but 
also to multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities as determined by 
Article 18(5) of Directive 2014/65/EU. 

The impact of technological developments and in particular algorithmic trading is one 
of  the  main  drivers  to  determine  the  capacity  and  arrangements  to  manage  trading 
venues. The risks arising from algorithmic trading can be present in any trading model 
that is supported by electronic means. Therefore, specific organisational requirements 
should apply to regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities and organised trading 
facilities  allowing  for  or  enabling  algorithmic  trading  through  their  systems 
considering  as  such  those  where  algorithmic  trading  may  take  place  as  opposed  to 
trading  venues  which  do  not  permit  algorithmic  trading,  including  trading  systems 
where transactions are arranged through voice negotiation.

Governance  arrangements, the role  of the compliance  function, staffing requirements 
and  outsourcing  should  be  regulated  as  part  of  these  organisational  requirements  to 
ensure the resilience of electronic trading systems.  

These  regulatory  technical  standards  set  out  the  requirements  to  be  met  by  trading 
venues  with  respect  to  their  systems  allowing  or  enabling  algorithmic  trading  as 
defined  under  Directive  2014/65/EU.  However,  their  specific  implementation  should 
take place in conjunction with a self-assessment to be conducted by each trading venue 
since  not  all  trading  models  present  the  same  risks.  Therefore,  some  organisational 
requirements might not be applicable for certain trading models although their trading 
systems could be supported to a certain extent  by electronic means. In particular, the 
specific  requirements  to  be  set  in  relation  to  request-for-quote  (RFQ)  or  hybrid 
systems  should  be  considered  according  to  the  nature,  scale  and  complexity  of  the 
algorithmic  trading  activity  undertaken.  Equally,  more  stringent  requirements  should 
be established by the trading venues where appropriate.  

Risks arising from algorithmic trading should be carefully taken into account, paying 
particular  attention  to  those  that  may  affect  the  core  elements  of  a  trading  system, 
including the hardware, software and associated communication lines used by trading 
venues and members, participants or clients of trading venues (hereinafter ‘members’) 
to  perform  their  activity  and  any  type  of  execution  systems  or  order  management 
systems operated by trading venues, including matching algorithms.  

The specific organisational requirements for trading venues have to be determined by 
means of a robust self-assessment where a number of parameters have to be assessed. 
That self-assessment should include any other circumstances not expressly set out that 
might have an impact on their organisation.  

The minimum period to keep the records of the self-assessment and the due diligence 
of members should be aligned with the general record-keeping obligations established 
in Directive 2014/65/EU. 

(9)

  Where trading venues are required to perform monitoring in real-time, the generation 
of  alerts  following  that  monitoring  should  be  done  as  close  to  instantaneously  as 
technically  possible,  with  a  time  delay  of  no  more  than  five  seconds.  Any  actions 
following  that  monitoring  should  be  undertaken  as  soon  as  possible  assuming  a 
reasonable level of efficiency and of expenditure on systems on the part of the persons 
concerned.   

(10)

  Testing facilities offered by trading venues should not pose risks to orderly trading. To 
that end, trading venues should establish an adequate fair usage policy, ensure a strict 
separation between the testing environment and the production environment or permit 
testing only out of trading hours.  

EN 

 

249 

EN 

 

 

 

(11)

(12)

  Conformance testing should ensure that the most basic elements of the system or the 
algorithms  used  by  members  operate  correctly  and  according  to  the  venue’s 
requirements,  including  the  ability  to  interact  as  expected  with  the  trading  venue’s 
matching  logic  and  the  adequate  processing  of  data  flows  to  and  from  the  trading 
venue.  Testing  against  disorderly  trading  conditions  should  be  designed  as  to 
specifically  address  the  reaction  of  the  algorithm  or  strategy  to  conditions  that  may 
create a disorderly market.  

  Where  trading  venues  offer  arrangements  to  test  algorithms  by  offering  testing 
symbols,  their  obligation  to  provide  facilities  to  test  against  disorderly  trading 
conditions  should be deemed fulfilled.  In order to  enable members to  effectively  use 
such 
the  specifications  and 
characteristics  of  the  testing  symbols  to  the  same  level  of  detail  made  publicly 
available for real life production contracts.  

trading  venues  should  publish 

testing  symbols, 

(13)

  Trading venues should be subject to an obligation to provide means to facilitate testing 
against  disorderly  trading  conditions.  However,  such  an  obligation  should  not  be 
construed as requiring their members to use those means. It should be considered as a 
sufficient  guarantee  if  trading  venues  receive  a  declaration  from  their  members 
confirming  that  such  testing  has  taken  place  and  the  means  used  for  that  testing,  but 
they  are  not  obliged  to  validate  the  adequacy  of  those  means  or  the  outcome  of  that 
testing.  

(14)

  Trading venues and their members have to be adequately equipped by means of a kill 
functionality  to  react  in  case  unexpected  circumstances  arise.  as  an  emergency 
measure to cancel unexecuted orders.  

(15)

  The provision of direct electronic access (DEA) service to an indeterminate number of 
persons may pose a risk to  the provider of that service and also  to  the resilience and 
capacity of the trading venue where the orders are sent. To address such risks, where 
sub-delegation of DEA is permitted, the DEA provider should be able to identify the 
different order flows from the beneficiaries of sub-delegation.  

(16)

  Where sponsored access is permitted by a trading venue, prospective sponsored access 
clients  should  be  subject  to  a  process  of  authorization  by  the  trading  venue.  Trading 
venues  may  also  decide  that  the  provision  of  direct  market  access  services  by  their 
members is subject to authorisation.  

(17)

  Trading venues should specify the requirements to be met by their members to provide 
DEA and determine the minimum standards to be met by prospective DEA clients in 
the due diligence process. Those requirements and standards should be adapted to the 
risks  posed  by  the  nature,  scale  and  complexity  of  their  expected  trading,  and  the 
service  being  provided.  In  particular,  it  should  include  an  assessment  of  the  level  of 
expected trading, the order volume and the type of connection offered.

peak of messages in accordance with the provision on the trading venue’s capacity;  

(c)  actions  planned  to  remedy  any  material  shortcomings  detected  in  the  course  of  their 
monitoring activity and after the periodic review of the performance and capacity of the 
trading systems.  

Article 4 

(Article 48(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Compliance function within the governance arrangements 

1.  Trading venues shall ensure that their compliance function is responsible for:  

(a)  providing clarity about the trading venues’ legal and regulatory obligations with respect 

to algorithmic trading;  

(b)  developing  and  maintaining  the  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  algorithmic 

trading systems comply with those obligations.  

2.  Trading  venues  shall  ensure  that  their  compliance  staff  has  at  least  a  general 
understanding of the way  in  which  algorithmic trading  systems  and algorithms operate.  The 
compliance function shall be in continuous contact with persons who have detailed technical 
knowledge  of  the  venue’s  algorithmic  trading  systems  or  algorithms.  Trading  venues  shall 
also  enable  compliance  staff  to  have,  at  all  times,  access  to  the  kill  functionality  or  to  the 
persons who can use the kill functionality and to those who are responsible for the algorithmic 
trading system. 

3.  Where  the  compliance  function,  or  elements  thereof,  is  outsourced  to  an  external 
compliance consultant, trading venues shall engage with, and provide information and access 
to  the  external  compliance  consultant  as  it  would  with  its  own  compliance  staff.  Trading 
venues shall enter into an agreement with such compliance consultants, ensuring that: 

(a)  data privacy is guaranteed;  

(b)  auditing of the compliance function by internal and external auditors or by the venue’s

assessment,  trading  venues  shall  inform  their  competent  authority  about  any  measures 
planned  to  expand  their  capacity  or  add  new  capabilities  together  with  the  implementation 
timeframe of such measures.    

6.  Trading  venues  shall  ensure  that  their  systems  are  able  to  cope  with  the  rising  message 
flow  without  material  degradation  of  their  systems  performance.  In  particular,  the  design  of 
the  trading  system  shall  enable  its  capacity  to  be  expanded  within  a  reasonable  timeframe 
whenever necessary.  

7.  Trading  venues  shall  immediately  make  public  and  report  to  their  competent  authority 
and  members  any  severe  trading  interruption  not  due  to  market  volatility  and  any  other

Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the 

requirements on market making agreements and schemes 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive  2011/61/EU1,  and  in  particular  Article  17(7)(a),  (b)  and  (c)  and  Article  48(12)(a) 
and (f) thereof,  

Whereas:

Two  main  goals  should  be  attained  in  specifying  the  market  making  obligations  of 
algorithmic  traders  pursuing  market  making  strategies  and  the  related  obligations  of 
trading venues. First, an element of predictability to the apparent liquidity in the order 
book should be introduced by establishing contractual obligations for investment firms 
pursuing market making strategies. Second, the presence of those firms in the market 
should be incentivised, particularly during stressed market conditions. 

The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  a  set  of 
related  obligations  for  investment  firms  engaged  in  algorithmic  trading  pursuing 
market making strategies and for trading venues where those market making strategies 
may  take  place.  To  ensure  coherence  between  those  provisions,  which  should  enter 
into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access 
to them by persons subject to those obligations, including investors that are non-Union 
residents, it is desirable to include these provisions in a single Regulation. 

The  provisions  of  this  Regulation  regarding  market  making  schemes  and  market 
making obligations should apply not only to regulated markets but also to multilateral 
trading  facilities  and  organised  trading  facilities  as  determined  by  Article  18(5)  of 
Directive 2014/65/EU.

  Market making strategies may relate to one or more financial instruments and one or 
more  trading  venues.  However,  in  certain  cases,  it  may  not  be  possible  for  a  trading 
venue  to  monitor  strategies  involving  more  than  one  trading  venue  or  instrument.  In 
those  cases,  trading  venues  should  be  able,  in  accordance  with  the  nature,  scale  and 
complexity  of  their  business,  to  monitor  market  making  strategies  pursued  on  their 
own venue, and therefore should restrict corresponding market making agreements and 
schemes to those situations only. 

(5)

 

(6)

 

(7)

 

(8)

 

All members or participants engaged in algorithmic trading pursuing a market making 
strategy  on  a  trading  venue  which  allows  for  or  enables  algorithmic  trading  should 
enter  into  a  market  making  agreement  with  the  operator  of  the  trading  venue. 
However,  incentives  under  a  market  making  scheme  should  only  be  required  for 
certain  instruments  traded  under  a  continuous  auction  order  book  trading  system. 
Nothing should prevent trading venues from establishing any other type of incentives 
at their own initiative for other financial instruments or trading systems. 

Cases where there is no mandatory requirement for trading venues to set out a market 
making scheme taking into account the nature and scale of the trading on those trading 
venues  should  be  clarified.  To  this  end,  it  is  appropriate  to  identify  financial 
instruments and trading systems increasing the risk of high volatility and for which it 
is crucial to incentivise the provision of liquidity for orderly and efficient functioning 
of markets.  In this respect,  this Regulation  should take into account  that  when liquid 
shares,  liquid  exchange  traded  funds,  options  and  futures  directly  related  to  those 
financial  instruments  as  well  as  liquid  equity  index  futures  and  liquid  equity  index 
options  are  algorithmically  traded  in  continuous  auction  order  book  trading  systems 
there is a greater risk of overreaction to external events which can exacerbate market 
volatility.  

Trading venues for which it is considered appropriate to have market making schemes 
in  place should review their existing agreements with  respect  to  those instruments to 
ensure  that  their  terms  in  respect  of  algorithmic  traders  pursuing  a  market  making 
strategy comply with these regulatory technical standards. 

The market making scheme may incentivise investment firms having signed a market 
making  agreement  to  perform  their  obligations  under  normal  trading  conditions  but 
should  provide  incentives  for  firms  effectively  contributing  to  liquidity  provision 
under  stressed  market  conditions.  Therefore,  under  stressed  market  conditions,  there 
should  be  a  scheme  of  incentives  to  limit  the  effects  of  a  sudden  and  large-scale 
withdrawal of liquidity. In order to avoid divergent application of this provision, it is 
important  for  trading  venues  to  communicate  the  existence  of  such  stressed  market 
conditions to all parties to the market making scheme. 

(9)

  Members,  participants  or  clients  having  signed  a  market  making  agreement  have  to 
meet a minimum set of requirements in terms of presence, size and spread in all cases. 
However,  the  members,  participants  or  clients  meeting  those  minimum  requirements 

EN 

277 

EN 

 

 

 

(10)

 

only under normal trading conditions may not necessarily access any type of incentive. 
Trading  venues  may  establish  market  making  schemes  which  only  reward  members, 
participants or clients meeting more stringent parameters in terms of presence, size and 
spread.  The  market  making  schemes  put  in  place  by  trading  venues  should  clearly 
indicate  the  conditions  for  accessing  incentives  and  should  take  into  account  the 
effective  contribution  to  the  liquidity  in  the  trading  venue  measured  in  terms  of 
presence, size and spread by the participants to the schemes. 

In order to prevent divergent application of this Regulation and to ensure fair and non-
discriminatory  implementation  of  market  making  schemes,  it  is  crucial  that  all 
members,  participants  and  clients  of  a  trading  venue  are  informed  in  a  coordinated 
manner  when  exceptional  circumstances  occur  or  when  trading  resumes  after  the 
occurrence  of  such  circumstances.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  specify  the  role  to  be 
played  by 
the  communication  of  exceptional 
circumstances and coordination of their members, participants or clients thereof.

Minimum market making obligations that trading venues must provide for when 

designing a market making scheme  

1.  Trading  venues  shall  describe  in  their  market  making  scheme  the  incentives  and  the 
parameters that must be met in terms of presence, size and spread to access those incentives 
under: 

(a)  normal  trading  conditions  where  the  trading  venue  decides  to  offer  incentives  in  such 
circumstances.  In  that  case,  the  market  making  scheme  may  include  a  condition  that 
only the best performer or performers receive those incentives; 

(b)  stressed market conditions taking into account the additional risks implied under those 

circumstances.  

2.  Trading  venues  shall  set  out  the  parameters  to  identify  stressed  market  conditions  in 
terms  of  significant  short-term  changes  of  price  and  volume.  Trading  venues  shall  consider 
the resumption of trading after volatility interruptions as stressed market conditions. 

 

Article 7

Fair and non-discriminatory market making schemes 

1.  Trading venues shall publish on their websites the terms of the market making schemes,

schemes to the participants in those schemes at least one month prior to their application. 

3.  Trading  venues  shall  provide  in  a  market  making  scheme  the  same  incentives  to  the 
participants who perform equally in terms of presence, size and spread. 

4.  Trading venues shall not limit the number of participants in a market making scheme but 
may  limit  the  access  to  the  incentives  included  in  this  scheme  to  the  firms  which  have  met 
pre-determined thresholds.  

5.  Trading  venues  shall  monitor  on  an  ongoing  basis  the  effective  compliance  of  the 
participants with the market making schemes. 

6.  Trading  venues  shall  establish  procedures  to  communicate  to  all  participants  in  market 
making  schemes  the  existence  of  stressed  market  conditions  on  its  venue  through  readily

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular Article 48(12)(b) thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

Trading  venues  should  have  a  number  of  systems,  procedures  and  arrangements  in 
place  to  ensure  that  algorithmic  trading  systems  cannot  create  or  contribute  to 
disorderly  trading  conditions  including  systems  to  monitor  and,  where  appropriate, 
limit  the ratio of unexecuted orders to  transactions. Taking into  account  their nature, 
voice  trading  systems  should  be  exempt  from  the  scope  of  this  regulation  which 
should  only  apply  to  trading  venues  operating  electronic  continuous  auction  order 
book, quote-driven or hybrid trading systems. 

Directive  2014/65/EU  extends  the  requirements  relating  to  the  determination  of  the 
ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  to  multilateral  trading  facilities  and 
organised  trading  facilities  and  it  is  therefore  important  that  those  venues  are  also 
within the scope of these regulatory technical standards. 

Trading venues have the ability to set out the maximum ratio of unexecuted orders to 
transactions  at  the  level  they  deem  appropriate,  for  instance  per  group  of  financial 
instruments with similar characteristics. However, trading venues should calculate the 
ratio effectively incurred by their members or participants at the level of each financial 
instrument  traded  on  them  to  ensure  effectively  that  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders 
does not lead to excessive volatility in that instrument. 

(4)

 

In order to ensure sufficient harmonisation across the Union of these arrangements, a 
clear  methodology  to  calculate  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  with 
respect to all market participants should be laid down.

The meaning of certain essential parameters to be used for the calculation of the ratio 
of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  should  be  clarified.  Definitions  are  an  essential 
element of the methodology and should therefore be set out in order to avoid divergent 
application across the Union.  

The  calculation  of  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  entered  into  the 
system  by  a  member  or  participant  should  be  supported  by  an  adequate  observation 
period. On that basis, the calculation period of the effective ratio of unexecuted orders 
to  transactions  should  not  be  longer  than  a  trading  session.  However,  trading  venues 
should  be  allowed  to  set  out  shorter  observation  periods  in  case  such  shorter 
observation  periods  would  contribute  more  effectively  to  maintain  orderly  trading 
conditions.   

Trading venues should be able to identify whether the observed pattern of the ratio of 
unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  of  any  of  their  members  or  participants  may 
contribute to disorderly trading conditions and to take measures considered necessary 
even if the maximum ratio has not been effectively breached. 

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date. 

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group

Obligation to calculate the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions 

Trading  venues  shall  calculate  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  effectively 
entered  into  the  system  by  each  of  their  members  and  participants  and  for  every  financial 
instrument traded under an electronic continuous auction order book, quote-driven or hybrid 
trading system. 

 

Article 2  

(Article 48(6) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Definitions 

For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply: 

(a)  ‘order’  means  all  input messages,  including  submission,  modification  and  cancellation 
sent  to  a  trading  venue’s  trading  system  relating  to  an  order  or  a  quote,  but  excluding 
cancellation messages sent subsequent to: 

(i)  uncrossing in an auction; 

(ii)  a loss of venue connectivity;  

(iii) the use of a kill functionality. 

(b)  ‘transaction’ means a totally or partially executed order;  

(c)  ‘volume’ means the quantity of financial instruments traded expressed as:  

(i)  the number of instruments for shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and 

other similar financial instruments;  

(ii)  the nominal value for bonds and structured finance products;  

(iii) the number of lots size or contracts for derivatives;  

(iv) metric tonnes of carbon dioxide for emission allowances. 

 

Article 3 

(Article 48(6) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Methodology  

1.  Trading venues shall calculate the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions for each of 
their  members  or  participants  at  least  at  the  end  of  every  trading  session  in  both  of  the 
following ways:  

EN 

287 

EN 

 

 

 

(a)  in volume terms: 

(Total volume of orders/Total volume of transactions) - 1;  

(b)  in number terms: 

(Total number of orders/Total number of transactions) - 1. 

2.  The maximum ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions determined by the trading venue 
shall be deemed as being exceeded by a member or participant of the trading venue during a 
trading session if the trading activity of that member or participant in one specific instrument, 
taking into account all phases of the trading session including the auctions, exceeds either of 
the two ratios set out in paragraph 1.  

3.  Trading  venues  shall  calculate  the  number  of  orders  effectively  received  from  each 
member  or  participant  following  the  counting  methodology  per  order  type  set  out  in  the 
Annex.  

4.  Where a trading venue uses an order type which is not explicitly laid down in the Annex, 
it  shall  count  the  messages  in  accordance  with  the  general  systematic  behind  the  counting 
methodology and as the most similar order type appearing in the Annex. 

 

Article 4  

Entry into force and application  

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth following that of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union. 

It shall apply from 3 January 2017. 

 

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

technical standards on requirements to ensure fair and non-discriminatory 

co-location and fee structures  

 

(Text with EEA relevance)  

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,  

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular Article 48(12)(d), 

Whereas:  

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

(4)

 

It  is  important  to  adopt  detailed  regulatory  technical  standards  to  clearly  identify 
conditions  when  co-location  and  fee  structures  used  by  trading  venues  may  be 
considered fair and non-discriminatory.  

Directive  2014/65/EU  extends  the  requirements  relating  to  co-location  and  fee 
structures  to  multilateral  trading  facilities  and  organised  trading  facilities  and  it  is 
therefore  important  to  ensure  that  those  venues  are  also  within  the  scope  of  this 
Regulation.  

In order to ensure a level playing field, it is necessary to impose common requirements 
to  all  types  of  co-location  services  and  to  apply  the  same  rules  to  trading  venues 
organising their own data centers and those using data centers owned or managed by 
third parties. 

Trading venues have the ability to determine their own commercial policy as regards 
co-location and determine which types of market participants they want to grant access 
to these services on the basis of objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.

Trading venues should not be forced to extend their co-location capacities beyond the 
limits  of  the  space,  power,  cooling  or  similar  facilities  available  and  should  have 
discretion to decide whether they expand their co-location space or not.  

Ensuring  fair  and  non-discriminatory  practice  in  relation  to  fee  structures  and  co-
location  requires  a  sufficient  degree  of  transparency  without  which  obligations  laid 
down in Directive 2014/65/EU could be easily circumvented.  

Objective  parameters  should  be  used  by  trading  venues  to  determine  rebates, 
incentives  and  disincentives  that  may  include  volumes  effectively  traded,  services 
effectively  used  and  the  provision  of  specific  services,  such  as  the  provision  of 
liquidity provided by an investment firm pursuing a market making strategy.  

The  implementation  of  any  fee  structure  that  contributes  to  disorderly  trading 
conditions through encouraging intensive trading and that leads to a potential stress of 
market  infrastructures  should  be  explicitly  prohibited.  However,  volume  discounts 
should still be allowed, since, as price differentiation schemes, they  are  based on the 
total  trading  volume,  the  total  number  of  trades  or  the  cumulated  trading  fees 
generated by one member whereby only the marginal trade executed subsequently to 
reaching the threshold is executed at a reduced price. 

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date.

supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 

Council on markets in financial instruments with regard to regulatory 

technical standards on the tick size regime for shares, depositary receipts 

and, exchange traded funds  

 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular Article 49(3) and (4) thereof,  

Whereas:  

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

A  tick  size  regime  or  minimum  tick  sizes  should  be  set  out  in  respect  of  certain 
financial  instruments  to  ensure  the  orderly  functioning  of  the  markets.  In  particular, 
the risk of an ever-decreasing tick size for shares, depositary receipts and certain types 
of  exchange-traded  funds  and  its  impact  on  the  orderliness  of  the  market  should  be 
controlled by means of a compulsory tick size regime. 

For  other  financial  instruments,  given  the  nature  of  these  instruments  and  the 
microstructures of the markets on which they are traded, the enactment of a tick size 
regime  for  those  instruments  cannot  be  presumed  to  effectively  contribute  to  the 
orderliness  of  the  markets  and,  hence,  these  instruments  should  not  be  subject  to  a 
mandatory tick size regime.  

In particular, certificates are only traded in certain Member States. Having taken into 
consideration  the  liquidity,  scale  and  nature  of  these  specific  markets  and  the 
characteristics of those financial instruments, no mandatory tick size regime is deemed 
necessary to prevent the occurrence of disorderly trading conditions.  

(4)

  With  respect  to  non-equity  financial  instruments  and  fixed  income  products,  a  large 
proportion  of  trading  remains  executed  OTC  with  only  a  limited  number  of

transactions  being  executed  on-venue.  Due  to  the  specific  characteristics  of  the 
liquidity of these instruments on electronic platforms and their fragmentation it is not 
deemed necessary to regulate a mandatory tick size regime for them.  

The  correlation  between  exchange-traded  funds  (ETFs)  and  the  underlying  equity 
instruments  makes  necessary  the  determination  of  a  minimum  tick  size  for  ETFs 
having  as  underlying  shares  and  depositary  receipts.  However,  ETFs  having  as 
underlying financial instruments which are not shares or depositary receipts should not 
be subject to these regulatory technical standards. 

For  ETFs,  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  circumvention,  it  is  important  that  all  ETFs 
covered by this Regulation have the same tick size regime based on a single liquidity 
band regardless of their average daily number of transactions. 

A  certain  number  of  technical  terms  should  be  clearly  defined  for  the  purposes  of 
setting  out  a  tick  size  regime.  Those  technical  definitions  are  necessary  to  ensure 
objective, effective and  harmonised application of the tick size regimes  in  the Union 
and,  hence,  contribute  to  the  establishment  of  a  single  rulebook  for  Union  financial 
markets in that respect. In particular, it appears essential to clarify the meaning of the 
most relevant market in terms of liquidity since Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council2 establishes two different definitions of most 
relevant market in terms of liquidity respectively for the purpose of the reference price 
waiver and for the purpose of transaction reporting. 

The  tick  size  regime  only  determines  the  minimum  difference  between  two  price 
levels  of  orders  sent  in  relation  to  a  financial  instrument  in  the  order-book.  As  a 
consequence,  it  should  be  applied  equally  regardless  of  the  currency  of  the  financial 
instrument. 

Competent authorities should have the ability to react to events known in advance that 
lead to a change in the number of transactions in a financial instrument whereby, as a 
result,  the  applicable  tick  size  may  no  longer  be  appropriate.  To  that  end,  a  specific 
procedure  should  be  set  out  to  avoid  disorderly  market  conditions  arising  from 
corporate  actions  that  may  cause  the  tick  size  of  one  specific  instrument  to  be 
unsuitable.  That  procedure  should  apply  to  corporate  actions  that  could  affect 
significantly  the  liquidity  of  this  instrument  including  splits,  reverse  splits,  scrip 
issues,  capital  repayments,  rights  issues,  entitlement  offers,  takeovers,  mergers  and 
stock  conversions.  While  assessing  the  impact  of  a  corporate  action  on  a  specific 
financial  instrument,  competent  authorities  should  take  account  of  any  previous 
corporate actions with similar characteristics.

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council3 applies  from  3  January 
2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from the 
same date. However, to ensure that the tick size regime can operate effectively from 3 
January 2017, and that market participants have sufficient time to implement the new 
requirements  by  that  date,  it  is  necessary  for  certain  transitional  provisions  to  apply 
from  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  this  Regulation.  These  transitional  provisions 
should  enable  the  collection  of  data  for  the  calculations  and  provide  for  an  earlier 
publication of the average  daily  number of transactions for each  financial  instrument 
covered by this Regulation.

Article 2 

(Article 49(1) and (2) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Tick size for shares, depositary receipts and exchange-traded funds  

1.  Trading venues shall apply to orders in shares or depositary receipts a tick size which is 
equal to or greater than the one corresponding to: 

(a)  the  liquidity  band  in  the  table  in  the  Annex  to  this  Regulation  corresponding  with  the 
average  daily  number  of  transactions  in  the  most  relevant  market  in  terms  of  liquidity 
for that instrument;   

(b)  the price range in that liquidity band corresponding to the price of the order. 

2.  By  way  of  derogation  from  paragraph  1(a),  where  the  most  relevant  market  in  terms  of 
liquidity  for  a  share  or  depositary  receipt  operates  only  a  periodic  auction  trading  system, 
trading  venues  shall  apply  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  the  lowest  average  daily 
number of transactions in the table in the Annex. 

For the purpose of the first subparagraph, a trading system shall be deemed to be a periodic 
auction trading system where orders are matched on the basis of a periodic auction and of a 
trading algorithm operated without human intervention. 

3.  Trading venues shall apply to orders in ETFs a tick size which is equal to or greater than 
the one corresponding to: 

(a)  the  liquidity  band  in  the  table  in  the  Annex  to  this  Regulation  corresponding  with  the 

highest average daily number of transactions;   

(b)  the price range in that liquidity band according to the price of the order. 

4.  The  requirements  set  out  in  paragraph  3  shall  apply  only  to  ETFs  having  as  sole 
underlying equities or a basket of equities subject to the tick size regime under paragraph 1.  

 

Article 3 

(Article 49(1) and (2) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Average daily number of transactions for shares and depositary receipts  

1.  By 1 March 2018 and by 1 March of each year thereafter, the competent authority for a 
specific share or depositary receipt shall, when determining the most relevant market in terms 
of  liquidity  for  that  share  or  depositary  receipt  also  calculate  the  average  daily  number  of 
transactions  for  that  financial  instrument  in  that  market  and  ensure  the  publication  of  that 
information.  

EN 

304 

EN 

 

 

 

The competent authority in the first sub-paragraph shall be the one specified in Article XX of 
Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  [insert  reference  to  Article  18  of  RTS  on  reporting 
obligations under Article 26 of MiFIR].  

2.  The calculation referred to in paragraph 1 shall have the following characteristics: 

(a)  it shall cover the period in the preceding year beginning on 1 January and ending on 31 
December  or,  where  applicable,  that  part  of  the  year  during  which  the  financial 
instrument was admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue and was not suspended 
from trading;  

(b)  it  shall  include  transactions  executed  under  the  rules  of  the  relevant  trading  venue 
excluding reference price and negotiated transactions as set out in Table 4 of Annex I of 
[RTS  1  on  equity  transparency]  and  transactions  executed  on  the  basis  of  at  least  one 
order that has benefitted from a large in scale waiver and where the transactions’ size is 
above the applicable large in scale threshold as determined in accordance with Article 7 
of [RTS 1 on equity transparency].  

This paragraph and paragraph 1 shall not apply to shares and depositary receipts first admitted 
to trading or traded on a trading venue after 30 November of the preceding year. 

3.  Trading  venues  shall  apply  the  tick  sizes  of  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  the 
average  daily  number  of  transactions  as  published  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  from  1 
April following that publication.  

4.  Before  the  first  admission  to  trading  or  before  the  first  day  of  trading  of  a  share  or 
depositary receipt, the competent authority of the trading venue where that instrument is to be 
first  admitted  to  trading  or  first  traded  shall  estimate  and  publish  the  estimate  average  daily 
number of transactions for that venue, taking into account the previous trading history of that 
instrument, where applicable, as well as the trading history of instruments that are considered 
to have similar characteristics.  

The  tick  size  of  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  that  published  estimate  average  daily 
number of transactions shall apply immediately after the publication of that estimate and until 
the publication of the average daily number of transactions for that instrument in accordance 
with paragraph 5. 

5.  No  later  than  six  weeks  after  the  share  or  depositary  receipt  has  started  trading,  the 
competent authority of the trading venue where the instrument was first admitted to trading or 
first traded on a trading venue shall calculate and ensure the publication of the average daily 
number of transactions in that financial instrument for that venue using the data relating to the 
first four weeks of trading of that financial instrument.  

The  tick  size  of  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  that  published  average  daily  number  of 
transactions  shall  apply  immediately  after  the  publication  and  continue  to  apply  until  a  new 

EN

EN 

 

 

 

average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  that  instrument  calculated  and  published  in 
accordance with the procedure set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 applies.  

6.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Article,  the  average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  a  given 
financial  instrument  shall  be  calculated  by  dividing,  for  the  relevant  time  period  and  the 
relevant  trading venue, the total  number of transactions in  that instrument  by the number of 
trading days. 

 

Article 4 

(Article 49(1) and (2) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Corporate actions 

Where a competent authority considers that a corporate action may modify the average daily 
number of transactions of a particular financial instrument such that this financial instrument 
falls  within  a  different  liquidity  band,  the  competent  authority  shall  determine  and  make 
public a new applicable liquidity band for that financial instrument treating it as if it were first 
admitted to trading or first traded on a trading venue and apply the procedure set out in Article 
3(4) and (5). 

 

Article 5 

Transitional provisions  

1.  The competent authority of the trading venue where a share or depositary receipt was first 
admitted  to  trading  or  traded  for  first  time  shall  collect  the  necessary  data,  calculate  and 
ensure  the  publication  of  the  average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  that  financial 
instrument and for that trading venue:  

(a)  by  1  December  2016  for  financial  instruments  traded  for  the  first  time  on  a  trading 

venue before 21 October 2016;

competent  authorities  shall  ensure  for  financial  instruments  referred  to  under  points  (b)  and 
(c) of paragraph 2 and for which they are the competent authority that those tick sizes do not 
contribute to disorderly trading conditions. Where a competent  authority identifies a risk for 
the  orderly  functioning  of  the  markets  for  such  an  instrument,  it  shall  determine  and  make 
public  an  updated  average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  that  financial  instrument  to 
address that risk on the basis of longer and more comprehensive trading history data for that 
instrument.  Trading  venues  shall  apply  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  this  updated 
average  daily  number  of  transactions  immediately  and  until  1  April  2018  or  any  further 
publication by the competent authority in accordance with this paragraph.

supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 

Council on markets in financial instruments with regard to regulatory 

technical standards on the determination of a material market in terms of 

liquidity relating to trading halt notifications 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1 , and in particular Article 48(12)(e) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

It  is  necessary  to  adopt  regulatory  technical  standards  to  clarify  which  regulated 
markets  should  be  considered  material  in  terms  of  liquidity  for  a  specific  financial 
instrument so that those markets have in place appropriate systems and procedures for 
notifying competent authorities of trading halts. 

Directive 2014/65/EU extends the requirements relating to trading halts to multilateral 
trading facilities and organised trading facilities and it is therefore important to ensure 
that  financial  instruments  traded  on  those  venues  are  also  within  the  scope  of  these 
regulatory technical standards.  

It  is  important  to  ensure  a  proportionate  application  of  the  notification  requirement. 
After  being  notified,  competent  authorities  are  obliged  to  assess  whether  this 
notification should be disseminated to the rest of the market and to coordinate, where 
necessary,  a  market-wide  response.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  limit  the  number  of 
notifying  venues  so  as  to  reserve  this  mechanism  for  the  market  with  the  greatest 
potential for market wide impact when trading is halted on that market. 

(4)

 

For  equity  and  equity-like  financial  instruments,  the  material  market  in  terms  of 
liquidity  should  be  the  trading  venue  with  the  highest  turnover  in  the  Union  in  the 
financial  instrument  concerned  since  this  venue  has  the  greatest  scope  for  causing

market wide impact when halting trading. This is specified as the most relevant market 
in  terms  of  liquidity  for  the  purposes  of  the  reference  price  waiver  and  that 
specification should therefore be incorporated into this Regulation.   

For non-equity financial instruments, the material market in terms of liquidity should 
be the regulated market where the financial instrument concerned was first admitted to 
trading or, if it is not admitted to trading on a regulated market, it should be the trading 
venue where it was first traded. This ensures certainty for a range of complex financial 
instruments  by  establishing  a  simple  reference  point  to  the  trading  venue  on  which 
events  have  important  liquidity  impacts  on  other  markets  trading  the  same  financial 
instrument, typically due to the significant share in terms of the volumes executed in 
that instrument on that venue.  

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 2 applies  from  3  January 
2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from the 
same date. 

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.  

ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council3,

reporting services providers 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 

Having  regard to  Directive 2014/65/EU of 15 May 2014 of the European Parliament  and of 
the  Council  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1 , and in particular Articles 61(4), 64(6), 64(8), 65(6), 65(8), and 66(5) 
thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

In accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU data reporting services providers cover three 
different  types  of  entities:  approved  reporting  mechanisms  (ARMs),  approved 
publication  arrangements  (APAs)  and  consolidated  tape  providers  (CTPs).  Although 
those  types  of  entities  are  engaged  in  different  activities,  Directive  2014/65/EU 
provides for a similar authorisation process for all of those entities. 

An  applicant  seeking  authorisation  as  a  data  reporting  services  provider  should 
provide  in  its  application  for  authorisation  a  programme  of  operations  and  an 
organisational  chart.  The  organisational  chart  should  identify  who  is  responsible  for 
the  different  activities  to  enable  the  competent  authority  to  assess  whether  the  data 
reporting  services  provider  has  sufficient  human  resources  and  oversight  over  its 
business.  The  organisational  chart  should  not  only  cover  the  scope  of  the  data 
reporting services, but  should also  include any other services that the entity provides 
as  this  may  highlight  areas  which  may  affect  the  independence  of  the  data  reporting 
services  provider  and  give  rise  to  a  conflict  of  interest.  An  applicant  seeking 
authorisation as a data reporting services provider should also provide information on 
the  composition,  functioning  and  independence  of  its  governing  bodies  in  order  for 
competent  authorities  to  be  able  to  assess  whether  the  policies,  procedures  and

corporate governance structure ensure the independence of the data reporting services 
provider and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.  

Conflicts of interest can arise between the data reporting services provider and  clients 
using  its  services  to  meet  their  regulatory  obligations  and  other  entities  purchasing 
data  from  data  reporting  services  providers.  In  particular,  those  conflicts  may  arise 
where the data reporting services provider is engaged in other activities such as acting 
as  a  market  operator,  investment  firm  or  trade  repository.  If  left  unaddressed,  this 
could lead to a situation where the data reporting services provider has an incentive to 
delay publication or submission or to trade on the basis of the confidential information 
it  has  received.  The  data  reporting  services  provider  should  therefore  adopt  a 
comprehensive  approach  to  identifying,  preventing  and  managing  existing  and 
potential conflicts of interest, including preparing an inventory of conflicts of interest 
and implementing appropriate policies and procedures to manage those conflicts and, 
where needed, separate business functions and personnel to limit the flow of sensitive 
information between different business areas of the data reporting services provider.  

All members of the management body of a data reporting services provider should be 
persons  who  are  of  sufficiently  good  repute  and  possess  sufficient  knowledge,  skills 
and  experience,  as  those  persons  play  a  key  role  in  ensuring  that  the  data  reporting 
services  provider  meets  its  regulatory  obligations  and  contribute  to  the  business 
strategy  of  the  data  reporting  services  provider.  It  is  therefore  important  for  the  data 
reporting services provider to  demonstrate that it  has a robust process for  appointing 
and  evaluating  the  performance  of  members  of  the  management  body  and  that  clear 
reporting lines and regular reporting to the management body are in place.  

The  outsourcing  of  activities,  in  particular  of  critical  functions,  is  capable  of 
constituting  a  material  change  of  the  conditions  for  the  authorisation  of  a  data 
reporting  services  provider.  To  ensure  that  the  outsourcing  of  activities  does  not 
impair  the  data  reporting  services  provider’s  ability  to  meet  its  obligations  under 
Directive  2014/65/EU  or  lead  to  conflicts  of  interest,  the  data  reporting  services 
provider  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  sufficient  oversight  and  control  over  those 
activities. 

The  IT systems  used by  a data reporting services provider should be well adapted to 
the  different  types  of  activities  these  entities  may  perform,  that  is  to  publish  trade 
reports, submit transaction reports or provide a  consolidated tape,  and robust enough 
to  ensure  continuity  and  regularity  in  the  provision  of  those  services.  This  includes 
ensuring  that  the  data  reporting  services  provider’s  IT  systems  are  able  to  handle 
fluctuations in the amount of data which it must handle. Such fluctuations, particularly 
unexpected increases in data flow, may adversely impact the effectiveness of the data 
reporting  services  provider’s  systems  and  as  a  result,  its  ability  to  publish  or  report 
complete and accurate information within the required timeframes. In order to handle 
this,  a  data  reporting  services  provider  should  periodically  test  its  systems  to  ensure 

EN 

315 

EN 

 

 

 

(7)

 

(8)

 

that they are robust enough to handle changes in operating conditions and sufficiently 
scalable.  

The  backup  facilities  and  arrangements  established  by  a  data  reporting  services 
provider should be sufficient to enable the data reporting services provider to carry out 
its  services,  even  in  the  event  of  a  disruptive  incident.  A  data  reporting  services 
provider  should  establish  maximum  acceptable  recovery  times  for  critical  functions 
that would apply in the event of a disruptive incident, which should allow compliance 
with the deadlines for reporting and disclosing the information. 

To  ensure  that  the  data  reporting  services  provider  can  deliver  its  services,  it  should 
undertake  an  analysis  of  which  tasks  and  activities  are  critical  to  the  delivery  of  its 
services and of possible scenarios that may give rise to a disruptive incident, including 
taking steps to prevent and mitigate those situations.    

(9)

  Where a service disruption occurs, a data reporting services provider should notify the 
competent  authority  of  its  home  Member  State,  any  other  relevant  competent 
authorities, clients and the public as the disruption could also mean that those parties 
would not be able to fulfil their own regulatory obligations such as the duty to forward 
transaction  reports  to  other  competent  authorities  or  to  make  public  the  details  of 
executed transactions. The notification should allow those parties to make alternative 
arrangements for meeting their obligations.  

(10)

  The deployment of any IT systems’ updates may potentially impact the effectiveness 
and  robustness  of  the  system.  A  data  reporting  services  provider  should  therefore 
make use of clearly delineated development and testing methodologies to ensure that 
the  operation  of  the  IT  system  is  compatible  with  its  regulatory  obligations,  that 
compliance and risk management controls embedded in the systems work as intended 
and  that  the  system  can  continue  to  work  effectively  in  all  conditions.  Where  a  data 
reporting services provider undertakes a significant system change, it should notify the 
competent authority of its home Member State and other competent authorities, where 
relevant,  so  they  can  assess  whether  the  update  will  impact  their  own  systems  and 
whether the conditions for authorisation continue to be met. 

(11)

  Premature public disclosure, in the case of trade reports, or unauthorised disclosure in 
the  case  of  transaction  reports  could  provide  an  indication  of  a  person’s  trading 
strategy  or  reveal  sensitive  information  such  as  the  identity  of  the  data  reporting 
services provider’s clients. Therefore, physical controls, such as locked facilities, and 
electronic  controls  including  firewalls  and  passwords  should  be    put  in  place  by  the 
data reporting services provider to  ensure that only authorised personnel  have access 
to the data.   

(12)

  Breaches  in  the  physical  or  electronic  security  of  a  data  reporting  services  provider 
pose a threat  to  the confidentiality of client  data. Consequently, where such a breach 
occurs,  a  data  reporting  services  provider  should  promptly  notify  the  relevant 

EN 

316 

EN 

 

 

 

competent  authority  as  well  as  any  clients  which  have  been  affected  by  the  breach. 
Notification  to  the  competent  authority  of  the  home  Member  State  is  necessary  to 
enable  that  competent  authority  to  carry  out  its  ongoing  supervisory  responsibilities 
with  respect  to  whether  the  data  reporting  services  provider  is  properly  maintaining 
sound  security  mechanisms  to  guarantee  the  security  of  the  information  and  to 
minimise  the  risk  of  data  corruption  and  unauthorised  access.  Other  competent 
authorities  which  have  a  technical  interface  with  the  data  reporting  services  provider 
should  also  be  notified  as  they  may  be  adversely  affected,  particularly  where  the 
breach  relates  to  the  means  of  transferring  information  between  the  data  reporting 
services provider and the competent authority. 

(13)

  An investment firm which has transaction reporting obligations, known as a ‘reporting 
firm’, may choose to use a third party to submit transaction reports on its behalf to an 
ARM,  that  is  a  'submitting  firm'.  By  virtue  of  its  role  the  submitting  firm  will  have 
access  to  the  confidential  information  that  it  is  submitting.  However,  the  submitting 
firm  should  not  be  entitled  to  access  any  other  data  about  the  reporting  firm  or  the 
reporting  firm’s  transactions  which  are  held  at  the  ARM.  Such  data  may  relate  to 
transaction reports which the reporting firm has submitted itself to the ARM or which 
it  has  sent  to  another  submitting  firm  to  send  to  the  ARM.  This  data  should  not  be 
accessible to the submitting firm as it may contain confidential information such as the 
identity of the reporting firm’s clients. 

(14)

  A  data  reporting  services  provider  should  monitor  that  the  data  it  is  publishing  or 
submitting  is  accurate  and  complete  and  should  ensure  that  it  has  mechanisms  for 
detecting errors or omissions caused by the client or itself. In the case of an ARM, this 
can include reconciliations of a sample population of data submitted to the ARM by an 
investment  firm  or  generated  by  the  ARM  on  the  investment  firm’s  behalf  with  the 
corresponding data provided by the competent authority. The frequency and extent of 
such  reconciliations  should  be  proportionate  to  the  volume  of  data  handled  by  the 
ARM and the extent to which it is generating transaction reports from clients’ data or 
passing on transaction reports completed by clients. In order to ensure timely reporting 
that  is  free  of  errors  and  omissions  an  ARM  should  continuously  monitor  the 
performance of its systems. 

(15)

  Where  an  ARM  itself  causes  an  error  or  omission,  it  should  correct  this  information 
without delay as well as notify the competent authority of its home Member State and 
any competent authority to which it submits reports of the error or omission as those 
competent  authorities  have  an  interest  in  the  quality  of  the  data  being  submitted  to 
them.  The  ARM  should  also  notify  its  client  of  the  error  or  omission  and  provide 
updated  information  to  the  client  so  that  the  client’s  internal  records  may  be  aligned 
with the information which the ARM has submitted to the competent authority on the 
client’s behalf.  

(16)

  APAs  and  CTPs  should  be  able  to  delete  and  amend  the  information  which  they 
receive from an entity providing them with information to deal with situations where 

EN 

317 

EN 

 

 

 

in exceptional circumstances the reporting entity is experiencing technical difficulties 
and cannot  delete or amend the information  itself. However, APAs and CTPs should 
not otherwise be responsible for correcting information contained in published reports 
where  the  error  or  omission  was  attributable  to  the  entity  providing  the  information. 
This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  APAs  and  CTPs  cannot  know  with  certainty  whether  a 
perceived  error  or  omission  is  indeed  incorrect  since  they  were  not  party  to  the 
executed trade.  

(17)

  To  facilitate  reliable  communication  between  an  APA  and  the  investment  firm 
reporting a trade, particularly in relation to cancellations and amendments of specific 
transactions,  an  APA  should  include  in  the  confirmation  messages  to  reporting 
investment firms the transaction identification code that has been assigned by the APA 
when making the information public. 

(18)

  To  comply  with  its  reporting  obligation  under  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the 
European Parliament and of the Council2, an ARM should ensure the smooth flow of 
information to and from a competent authority, including the ability to transfer reports 
and deal with rejected reports. The ARM should therefore be able to demonstrate that 
it  can  comply  with  the  technical  specification  required  by  the  competent  authority, 
which  sets  out  the  necessary  rules  and  protocols  to  govern  the  interface  between  the 
ARM and the competent authority. 

(19)

  A data reporting services provider should also ensure that it stores the transaction and 
trade  reporting  information  which  it  handles  for  a  sufficiently  long  period  of  time  in 
order  to  facilitate  the  retrieval  of  historical  information  by  competent  authorities.  In 
the  specific  case  of  APAs  and  CTPs,  they  should  ensure  that  they  establish  the 
necessary  organisational  arrangements  to  maintain  the  data  for  at  least  the  period 
specified in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and are able to respond to any request. 

(20)

  This Regulation sets out a number of additional services a CTP could perform which 
increase the efficiency of the market. A CTP should be able to provide further services 
going  beyond  the  additional  services  specifically  listed  in  this  Regulation  provided 
that  those  other  services  do  not  pose  a  risk  to  the  independence  of  the  CTP  or  the 
quality of the consolidated tape.  

(21)

 

In  order  to  ensure  efficient  dissemination  of  information  made  public  by  APAs  and 
CTPs  and  an  easy  access  and  use  of  such  information  by  market  participants,  the 
information should be published in a machine readable format through robust channels 
allowing  for  automatic  access  to  the  data.  While  websites  may  currently  not  always 

                                                 

2  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in  financial 
instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 84).

offer  an  architecture  that  is  robust  and  scalable  enough  and  that  allows  for  easy 
automatic  access  to  data,  these  technological  constraints  may  be  overcome  in  the 
future. A particular technology should therefore not be prescribed, but criteria should 
be set out that need to be met by the technology which is to be used.  

(22)

  With respect to equity and equity-like instruments, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 does 
not  exclude  that  investment  firms  make  public  their  transactions  through  more  than 
one  APA.  However,  a  specific  arrangement  should  be  in  place  to  enable  interested 
parties consolidating the trade information from various APAs, in particular CTPs, to 
identify  such  potential  duplicate  trades  as  otherwise  the  same  trade  might  be 
consolidated  several  times,  and  published  repeatedly  by  the  CTPs.  This  would 
undermine the quality and usefulness of the consolidated tape. 

(23)

  When  publishing  a  transaction,  APAs  should  therefore  publish  transactions  reported 
by  investment  firms  by  including  a  ‘reprint’  field  indicating  whether  a  report  is  a 
duplicate. In order to allow for an approach that is neutral in terms of the technology 
used  it  is  necessary  to  provide  for  different  possible  ways  in  which  an  APA  can 
identify duplicates.  

(24)

 

In order to ensure that each transaction is only included once in the consolidated tape 
and  therefore  to  strengthen  the  reliability  of  the  provided  information,  CTPs  should 
not  publish  information  in  relation  to  a  transaction  published  by  an  APA  which  is 
identified as duplicative. 

(25)

  APAs should publish information on transactions, including the relevant time stamps, 
such  as  the  time  when  transactions  were  executed  and  the  time  transactions  were 
reported. This is the most meaningful from the perspective of data users. Furthermore, 
the  granularity  of  the  time  stamps  should  reflect  the  nature  of  the  trading  system  on 
which  the  transaction  was  executed.  A  greater  granularity  should  be  provided  when 
publishing  information  on  transactions  executed  in  electronic  systems  than  on 
transactions executed in non-electronic systems.  

(26)

  CTPs  may  publish  information  on  equity  and  non-equity  instruments.  Given  the 
different  requirements  for  the  operation  of  those  tapes,  and  in  particular  the 
significantly  broader  scope  of  financial 
instruments  covered  for  non-equity 
instruments  and  the  deferred  application  of  the  provisions  for  the  non-equity 
consolidated  tape,  this  Regulation  only  specifies  the  scope  of  the  CTP  consolidating 
information on equity-instruments.  

(27)

  The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  the 
authorisation, organisational requirements and the publication of transactions for data 
reporting  services  providers.  To  ensure  coherence  between  those  provisions,  which 
should  enter  into  force  at  the  same  time,  and  to  facilitate  a  comprehensive  view  and 
compact  access  to  them  by  persons  subject  to  those  obligations,  including  investors 

EN 

319 

EN 

 

 

 

that  are  non-Union  residents,  it  is  desirable  to  include  these  regulatory  technical 
standards in a single Regulation. 

(28)

  This  Regulation  specifies  the  data  publication  requirements  applicable  to  APAs  and 
CTPs.  In  order  to  ensure  consistent  practices  for  publishing  trade  information  across 
trading  venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  and  to  facilitate  the  consolidation  of  data  by  CTPs, 
this  Regulation  should  apply  in  conjunction  with  Regulation  (EU)  No  [RTS  1  on 
equity  transparency]  and  Regulation  (EU)  No  [RTS  2  on  non-equity  transparency] 
where detailed requirements applicable to the publication of trade information are set 
out. 

(29)

  The  requirements  in  respect  of  data  reporting  services  providers  set  out  in  Directive 
2014/65/EU  should  apply  from  3  January  2017  with  the  exception  of  Article  65(2) 
which applies from 3 September 2018. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same dates. 

(30)

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

(31)

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group

(b)  may have an interest in the outcome of a service provided to a client, which is distinct 

from the client’s interest in that outcome;  

(c)  may have an incentive to prioritise its own interests or the interest of another client or 

group of clients rather than the interests of a client to whom the service is provided;  

(d)  receives  or  may  receive  from  any  person  other  than  a  client,  in  relation  to  the  service

laws  and  regulatory 

in  compliance  with  applicable 

activities  effectively  and 
requirements and adequately addresses identified failures; 

(b)  the identification of the risks in  relation  to  outsourced activities and adequate periodic

accurately publish the trade reports received from investment firms and, in the case of CTPs, 
from  trading  venues  and  APAs,  without  themselves  introducing  any  errors  or  omitting 
information  and  shall  correct  information  where  they  have  themselves  caused  the  error  or 
omission.

including the transaction identification code assigned by the APA. An APA shall refer to the 
transaction  identification  code  in  any  subsequent  communication  with  the  reporting  firm  in 
relation to a specific trade report.  

5.  An APA shall set up and maintain appropriate arrangements to identify on receipt trade 
reports  that  are  incomplete  or  contain  information  that  is  likely  to  be  erroneous.  These 
arrangements shall include automated price and volume alerts, taking into account: 

(a)  the sector and the segment in which the financial instrument is traded;

delete or amend its own information for technical reasons. 

8.  APAs  shall  publish  non-discretionary  policies  on 
information  cancellation  and 
amendments in trade reports which set out the penalties that APAs may impose on investment

reports  that  are  incomplete  or  contain  obvious  errors  caused  by  clients.  An  ARM  shall 
perform  validation  of  the  transaction  reports  against  the  requirements  established  under 
Article  26  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  for  field,  format  and  content  of  fields  in 
accordance  with  Table  1  of  Annex  I  to  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  on  [transaction 
reporting]. 

2.  An  ARM  shall  set  up  and  maintain  appropriate  arrangements  to  identify  transaction 
reports which contain errors or omissions caused by that ARM itself and to correct, including 
deleting or amending, such errors or omissions. An ARM  shall perform  validation for field, 
format  and  content  of  fields  in  accordance  with  Table  1  of  Annex  I  to  Regulation  (EU)  [on 
transaction reporting].

that  a  transaction  report  it  has  received  has  been  successfully  reported  to  the  competent 
authority in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.  

4.  An ARM shall perform periodic reconciliations at the request of the competent authority 
of its home Member State or the competent authority to whom the ARM submits transaction 
reports  between  the  information  that  the  ARM  receives  from  its  client  or  generates  on  the 
client’s  behalf  for  transaction  reporting  purposes  and  data  samples  of  the  information 
provided by the competent authority.  

5.  Any  corrections,  including  cancellations  or  amendments  of  transaction  reports,  that  are 
not correcting errors or omissions caused by an ARM, shall only be made at the request of a 
client and per transaction report. Where an ARM cancels or amends a transaction report at the 
request of a client, it shall provide this updated transaction report to the client.  

6.  Where an ARM, before submitting the transaction report, identifies an error or omission 
caused  by  a  client,  it  shall  not  submit  that  transaction  report  and  shall  promptly  notify  the 
investment  firm  of  the  details  of  the  error  or  omission  to  enable  the  client  to  submit  a 
corrected set of information.  

7.  Where an ARM becomes aware of errors or omissions caused by the ARM itself, it shall 
promptly submit a correct and complete report.  

8.  An  ARM  shall  promptly  notify  the  client  of  the  details  of  the  error  or  omission  and 
provide  an  updated  transaction  report  to  the  client.  An  ARM  shall  also  promptly  notify  the 
competent  authority  of  its  home  Member  State  and  the  competent  authority  to  whom  the 
ARM reported the transaction report about the error or omission. 

The  requirement  to  correct  or  cancel  erroneous  transaction  reports  or  report  omitted 
transactions  shall  not  extend  to  errors  or  omissions  which  occurred  more  than  five  years 
before the date that the ARM became aware of such errors or omissions.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,  

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/20121
 and 
in particular the third subparagraph of Article 12(2) thereof,  

Whereas:  

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

In order to reduce costs for market participants when purchasing data, Regulation (EU) 
No  600/2014  provides  for  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency  data  to  be  made 
available  to  the  public  in  an  “unbundled”  fashion  for  separate  data  items.  It  is 
necessary  to  specify  the  level  of  disaggregation  by  which  venues  should  offer  data. 
Taking  into  account  the  evidence  of  demand  for  such  data  from  other  stakeholders, 
market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue should disaggregate 
data  by  asset  class,  by  country  of  issue,  by  the  currency  in  which  an  instrument  is 
traded,  and  according  to  whether  data  comes  from  scheduled  daily  auctions  or  from 
continuous trading.  

To ensure that pre- and post-trade data offered appropriately matches the demand from 
market participants, market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue 
should offer any combination of the disaggregation criteria set  out  in this Regulation 
on a reasonable commercial basis. 

For some financial instruments such as for derivatives it may not always be possible to 
determine  unambiguously  the  particular  asset  class  to  which  that  instrument  belongs 
since  the  determination  of  an  asset  class  depends  on  which  characteristics  of  the 
instruments  are  considered  to  be  the  decisive  ones.  Similarly,  it  may  not  always  be 
possible  to  unambiguously  determine  which  other  criteria  a  type  of  data  meets.  To

ensure that market participants purchasing data from a particular trading venue receive 
a  consistent  data  set,  it  is  necessary  to  require  market  operators  or  investment  firms 
operating a trading venue to determine in those cases where the disaggregation criteria 
application cannot be applied in an unambiguous manner which criteria an instrument 
or type of data meets.  

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date. 

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament 

and of the Council on markets in financial instruments with regard to 
regulatory technical standards on clearing access in respect of central 

counterparties and trading venues  

(Text with EEA relevance) 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/20121, and in particular Articles 35(6) and 36(6) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

To prevent distortion of competition, central counterparties (CCPs) as well as trading 
venues  should  only  be  able  to  deny  an  access  request  where  they  have  made  all 
reasonable efforts to manage the risk arising from granting that access but significant 
undue risk remains. 

In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 if a CCP or trading venue denies an 
access  request  it  has  to  provide  full  reasons  for  that  decision  and  this  includes 
identifying how the relevant risks arising from granting access would in the particular 
situation  be  unmanageable  and  that  there  would  be  significant  undue  risk  remaining. 
An appropriate way of doing this is for the party denying access to clearly outline the 
changes that would arise from granting access, how it would have to manage the risk 
associated with changes in consequence of granting access, and to explain the impact 
on its structures.  

Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  does  not  distinguish  between  risks  incurred  by  CCPs 
and trading venues when granting access and includes the same general categories of 
conditions  to  be  considered  by  trading  venues  and  CCPs  when  assessing  access 
requests. However, due to the different nature of the activities of CCPs as compared to 
trading venues, risks stemming from granting access may in practice impact CCPs and

trading venues differently, thus demanding an approach differentiating between CCPs 
and trading venues. 

(4)

  When  a  competent  authority  assesses  whether  access  would  threaten  the  smooth  and 
orderly functioning of the markets or adversely affect systemic risk, it should consider 
whether  the  CCP  or  trading  venue  in  question  has  adequate  risk  management 
procedures,  including  with  respect  to  operational  and  legal  risks,  to  avoid  the  access 
agreement creating significant undue risks to third parties that cannot be mitigated. 

(5)

 

The  terms  under  which  access  must  be  permitted  should  be  reasonable  and  non-
discriminatory  so  as  not  to  undermine  the  purpose  for  which  the  access  provisions 
were  introduced.  Charging  fees  in  a  discriminatory  way  so  as  to  deter  access  should 
not be permitted. However, fees could differ for objectively justified reasons, such as 
where the costs to implement the access arrangements are higher. When access results 
in  a  trading  venue  dealing  with  two  or  more  CCPs,  it  is  important  to  specify  how 
trades on the trading venue will be allocated to the CCP that is party to the agreement, 
if the agreement creates a situation where there are two or more CCPs with access to 
the trading venue . 

(6)

  When  granting  access  CCPs  and  trading  venues  incur  both  one-off  costs,  such  as 
assessing legal requirements, and ongoing costs. Since the scope of the access request 
and the associated costs for implementing the access agreement are likely to differ on 
a  case-by-case  basis,  it  is  not  appropriate  to  cover  the  specific  allocation  of  costs 
between the CCP and the trading venue in this Regulation, However, the allocation of 
costs  is  an  important  element  of  an  access  agreement,  therefore  both  parties  should 
specify in the access arrangement the coverage of costs.  

(7)

 

Pursuant  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council2, a CCP wishing to extend its business to additional services or activities not 
covered  by  the  initial  authorisation  should  submit  a  request  for  an  extension  of 
authorisation.  An  extension  of  authorisation  is  needed  where  a  CCP  intends  to  offer 
clearing  services  on  financial  instruments  with  a  different  risk  profile  or  that  have 
material differences from the CCP’s existing product set. When a contract traded on a 
trading venue to which a CCP has granted access is in a class of financial instruments 
covered  by  the  CCP’s  existing  authorisation  and  has  therefore  similar  risk 
characteristics  to  the  contracts  already  cleared  by  the  CCP,  such  a  contract  is  to  be 
considered as economically equivalent.  

(8)

 

In order to ensure that a CCP does not apply discriminatory collateral and margining 
requirements to  economically equivalent  contracts traded on a trading venue that has 
been  granted  access  to  the  CCP,  any  change  to  the  margining  methodology  and 

                                                 

2  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  4  July  2012  on  OTC 
derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 1). 

EN

EN 

 

 

 

(9)

 

operational  requirements  regarding  margining  and  netting  applied  to  economically 
equivalent contracts already cleared by the CCP should be subject to a review by the 
risk committee of the CCP and be considered as a significant change to the models and 
parameters  for  the  purpose  of  the  review  procedure  as  provided  for  by  Regulation 
(EU) No 648/2012. Such a review should validate that the new models and parameters 
are non-discriminatory and based on relevant risk considerations. 

Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  prevents  competitive  distortions  by  requiring  non-
discriminatory access to CCPs offering clearing of OTC derivatives to trading venues. 
In  turn,  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  recognises  the  need  to  introduce  similar 
requirements  for  regulated  markets.  Given  that  a  CCP  may  clear  both  OTC  and 
exchange-traded derivatives, non-discriminatory treatment of economically equivalent 
contracts  traded  on  a  trading  venue  requesting  access  to  a  CCP  should  take  into 
account all relevant contracts cleared by that CCP, irrespective of where the contracts 
are traded. 

(10)

  Article  35  (6)(e)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  refers  to  the  cross-margining  of 
correlated contracts. The term “portfolio margining” should be used when referring to 
correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP, rather than “cross-margining” which is 
used  in  contexts  involving  margining  between  two  CCPs,  e.g.  in  relation  to 
interoperability arrangements. 

(11)

  A notification by a relevant competent authority to the CCP college and the European 
Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  about  the  approval  of  CCP  transitional 
arrangements in  accordance with  Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014  should 
be made without undue delay in order to assist other relevant competent authorities to 
understand  the  impact  this  will  have  on  the  CCP  and  any  trading  venues  that  are 
connected  by  close  links  to  that  CCP.  The  notification  should  contain  all  relevant 
information  necessary  to  enable  the  CCP  college  and  ESMA  to  understand  the 
decision and to enhance transparency.  

(12)

  Clear requirements about the information to be provided by CCPs and trading venues 
when  notifying  competent  authorities  and  ESMA  that  they  wish  to  benefit  from 
transitional  arrangements  in  accordance  with  Articles  35  and  36  of  Regulation  (EU) 
No  600/2014    should  contribute  to  a  transparent  and  harmonised  application  of  the 
notification  procedure.  It  is  therefore  necessary  for  the  notification  procedure  to 
include uniform  templates for the notifications so as to  enable consistent supervisory 
practices and a level playing field.   

(13)

 

It is important to avoid the risk of larger trading venues using calculation methods that  
minimise  their  annual  notional  amount  with  the  aim  of  benefiting  from  the  opt-out 
mechanism  to  the  access  provisions.  Where  there  are  equally  accepted  alternative 
approaches  to  calculating  notional  amount,  using  the  calculation  which  gives  the 
higher value helps avoid that risk. The methods used for calculating notional amount 
for  the  purposes  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  should  enable  genuinely  smaller 

EN 

344 

EN 

 

 

 

trading venues that have not  yet  acquired the technological  capability to  engage on a 
level  playing  field  with  the  majority  of  the  post-trade  infrastructure  market  to  make 
use  of  the  opt-out  mechanism.  It  is  also  important  for  the  methods  prescribed  to  be 
straightforward  and  unambiguous  in  order  to  contribute  to  consistent  supervisory 
practices and a level playing field. 

(14)

 

It  is  important  for  trading  venues  to  be  consistent  about  calculating  their  notional 
amount for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 so that the access provisions 
can be applied fairly by trading venues. This is particularly relevant for certain types 
of exchange-traded derivatives, traded in units, such as barrels or tons.  

(15)

  The requirements in respect of non-discriminatory access to CCPs and trading venues 
set  out  in  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  apply  from  3  January  2017.  To  ensure 
consistency  and  legal  certainty,  this  Regulation  should  apply  from  the  same  date. 
However,  to  ensure  that  CCPs  and  trading  venues  may  benefit  from  the  transitional 
arrangements,  it  is  necessary  for  certain  transitional  provisions  to  apply  at  an  earlier 
date. 

(16)

  The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  the  denial 
and granting of access to CCPs and trading venues, incl. the procedure for CCPs and 
trading  venues  to  opt  out.  To  ensure  coherence  between  those  provisions,  most  of 
which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view 
and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations, it is desirable to 
include these regulatory technical standards in a single Regulation. 

(17)

  This  Regulation  is  based  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical  standards  submitted  by 

ESMA to the Commission.  

(18)

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European

Non-discriminatory access to CCPs and Trading Venues 

Article 1 

Conditions on the denial of access by a CCP  

1.  A  CCP  shall  assess  whether  granting  access  would  create  any  of  the  risks  specified  in 
Articles 2, 3 and 4 and may deny access only if, after making all reasonable efforts to manage 
its risks, there remain significant undue risks that cannot be managed. 

If a CCP denies access, it shall identify which risks specified in Articles 2, 3 and 4 would 

2. 
result from granting access and why those risks cannot be managed. 

 

Article 2 

Denial of access by a CCP based on the anticipated volume of transactions 

A  CCP  may  deny  an  access  request  on  grounds  of  the  anticipated  volume  of  transactions 
arising from such access only where this would result in one of the following: 

(a)  exceeding the scalable design of the CCP to such an extent that the CCP cannot adapt its 

systems so as to deal with the anticipated volume of transactions;  

(b)  exceeding the planned capacity of the CCP in a way that the CCP would not be able to 

acquire the required extra capacity to clear the anticipated volume of transactions. 

 

Denial of access by a CCP based on operational risk and complexity 

Article 3 

A CCP may deny an access request on grounds of operational risk and complexity.  

Relevant types of risks shall include any of the following: 

(a)  incompatibility of CCP and trading venue IT systems impeding the CCP to provide for 

connectivity between the systems; 

(b)  lack of human resources with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience to perform 
the CCP’s functions regarding the risk stemming from additional financial instruments 
where these differ from financial instruments already cleared by the CCP or inability to 
deploy such human resources.

Denial of access by a CCP based on other factors creating significant undue risks 

1.  A CCP may deny an access request on grounds of significant undue risks where:  

(a)  the  CCP  does  not  offer  clearing  services  in  respect  of  the  financial  instruments  for 
which access is being requested and would not be able with reasonable efforts to launch 
a  clearing  service  consistent  with  the  requirements  set  out  in  Titles  II,  III  and  IV  of 
Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;  

(b)  granting access would threaten the economic viability of the CCP or its ability to meet 

minimum capital requirements under Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012; 

(c)  there are legal risks;  

(d)  there  is  an  incompatibility  of  CCP  rules  and  trading  venue  rules  that  the  CCP  cannot 

remedy in cooperation with the trading venue. 

2.  A CCP may refuse an access request based on legal risk as referred to in paragraph 1(c), 
where as a result of granting access, the CCP would not be able to enforce its rules relating to 
close  out  netting  and  default  procedures  or  cannot  manage  the  risks  arising  from  the 
simultaneous use of different trade acceptance models.  

 

Article 5 

Conditions on the denial of access by a trading venue 

1.  A  trading  venue  shall  assess  whether  granting  access  would  create  any  of  the  risks 
specified in Articles 6 and 7 and may deny access only if, after making all reasonable efforts 
to manage its risks, there remain significant undue risks that cannot be managed. 

If a trading venue denies access, it shall identify which risks specified in Articles 5 and 6 

2. 
would result from granting access and why those risks cannot be managed. 

 

Article 6 

Denial of access by a trading venue based on operational risk and complexity 

A trading venue may deny  an  access  request  on  grounds of  operational risk and complexity 
arising from such access only if the relevant types of risks could result in incompatibility of 
CCP  IT  systems  and  trading  venue  IT  systems,  impeding  the  trading  venue  to  provide  for 
connectivity between those systems.

Article 7 

347 

EN 

 

 

 

Denial of access by a trading venue based on other factors creating significant undue 

risks 

A trading venue may deny an access request on grounds of significant undue risks in any of 
the following cases: 

(a)  threat  to  the  economic  viability  of  the  trading  venue  or  its  ability  to  meet  minimum 
capital  requirements  under  Article  47(1)(f)  of  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council4,  

(b)  incompatibility  of  trading  venue  rules  and  CCP  rules  that  the  trading  venue  cannot 

remedy in cooperation with the CCP. 

 

Article 8 

Conditions under which access will threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of 

markets or adversely affect systemic risk 

In addition to liquidity fragmentation, as defined in Article 2(1)(45) of  Regulation (EU) No 
600/2014,  for  the  purposes  of  Articles  35(4)(b)  and  36(4)(b)  of  that  Regulation,  granting 
access  will  threaten  the  smooth  and  orderly  functioning  of  the  markets,  or  adversely  affect 
systemic risk, where the competent authority can provide full reasons for the denial, including 
evidence  that  the  risk  management  procedures  of  one  or  both  of  the  parties  to  the  access 
request are insufficient to prevent the granting of access from creating significant undue risks 
to  third  parties,  and  there  is  no  remedial  action  that  would  sufficiently  mitigate  those 
inadequacies.

Conditions under which access must be permitted  

Article 9  

Conditions under which access must be permitted 

1.  The parties shall agree on their respective rights  and obligations arising from the access 
granted,  including  the  applicable  law  governing  their  relationships.  The  terms  of  the  access

pursuant  to  Directive  98/26/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council5,  into 
relevant systems and the moment of irrevocability; 

(d)  contain  rules  regarding  the  termination  of  the  access  agreement  by  any  of  the  parties, 

which shall: 

(i)  provide for termination in an orderly manner that does not unduly expose other 
entities to additional risks, including clear and transparent arrangements for the 
management  and  orderly  run-off  of  contracts  and  positions  made  under  the 
access agreement that were open at the point of termination; 

(ii)  ensure  that  the  relevant  party  is  given  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  to  remedy 

any breach that does not give rise to immediate termination; 

(iii) allow the termination, if risks increase in a way that would have justified denial 

of access in the first instance;  

(e)  specify the financial instruments being subject to the access agreement;  

(f)  specify the cover of the one-off and ongoing costs triggered by the access request;  

(g)  contain provisions for claims and liabilities stemming from the access agreement. 

2.  The terms  of the access  agreement  shall require that the parties to  the agreement put  in 
place adequate policies, procedures and systems to ensure the following: 

(a)  timely, reliable and secure communication between the parties; 

(b)  prior consultation to the other party where changes to either party’s operations are likely 
to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  access  agreement  or  on  the  risks  to  which  the  other 
party is exposed; 

(c)  timely notification to  the other party before a change is  implemented, in  the cases not 

covered by point (b);

(b)  that  information  provided  in  the  request  for  access  is  kept  up-to-date  throughout  the 

duration of the access agreement, including information about material changes;  

(c)  that non-public and commercially sensitive information including information provided

Non-discriminatory and transparent clearing fees charged by CCPs 

Article 10 

1.  A  CCP  shall  only  charge  fees  for  clearing  transactions  executed  on  a  trading  venue  to 
which  it  has  granted  access  on  the  basis  of  objective  criteria,  applicable  to  all  clearing 
members and, where relevant, clients.  Fees shall not depend on the trading venue where the 
transaction takes place.  

2.  A CCP shall make all clearing members and, where relevant, clients subject to the same 
schedule of fees and rebates.  

3.  A  CCP  shall  only  charge  fees  to  a  trading  venue  in  relation  to  access  on  the  basis  of 
objective  criteria.  The  same  fees  and  rebates  shall  apply  to  all  trading  venues  accessing  the 
CCP with regard to the same or similar financial instruments, unless a different fee schedule 
can be objectively justified.  

4. 
In accordance with Article 38 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 a CCP shall ensure that 
the  fee  schedules  referred  to  in  paragraphs  1,  2  and  3  of  this  Article  are  easily  accessible, 
adequately identified per service provided and sufficiently granular in order to ensure that fees 
charged are predictable.  

5.  For the purpose of paragraphs 1 to 4, relevant fees are fees charged to cover one-off and 
ongoing costs.

Non-discriminatory and transparent fees charged by trading venues 

Article 11 

1.  A  trading  venue  shall  only  charge  fees  in  relation  to  access  on  the  basis  of  objective 
criteria. The same schedule of fees and rebates shall apply to all CCPs accessing the trading 
venue with regard to the same or similar financial instruments, unless a different fee schedule 
can be objectively justified.  

2.  A trading venue shall ensure that the fee schedules referred to in paragraph 1 are easily 
accessible,  that  the  fees  are  adequately  identified  per  service  provided  and  sufficiently 
granular in order to ensure that the arising fees are predictable.  

3.  Paragraphs  1  and  2  shall  apply  to  all  fees  related  to  access,  including  those  that  are 
charged to cover one-off and ongoing costs.  

 

 

SECTION III 

Condtions for non-discriminatory treatment of contracts  

Article 12 

Collateral and margining requirements of economically equivalent contracts 

1.  The CCP shall determine whether  contracts  traded on the trading venue  to  which it has 
granted  access  are  economically  equivalent  to  contracts  with  similar  risk  characteristics 
already cleared by the CCP. For the purpose of this Article, a CCP shall consider all contracts 
traded on the trading venue to which it has granted access, which are in the class of financial 
instruments covered by the CCP’s authorisation referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 
No  648/2012,  or  by  any  subsequent  extension  of  authorisation  referred  to  in  Article  15  of 
Regulation  (EU)  No 648/2012,  as economically equivalent  to  the  contracts in  the respective 
class of financial instruments already cleared by the CCP.  

2.  A  CCP  may  consider  a  contract  traded  on  the  trading  venue  to  which  it  has  granted 
access,  which  presents  a  significantly  different  risk  profile  or  material  differences  from  the 
contracts already cleared by the CCP in the respective class of financial instruments, as non-
economically  equivalent  where  the  CCP  had  obtained  an  extension  of  the  authorisation 
pursuant  to  Article  15  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  with  respect  to  that  contract  and  in 
connection with that trading venue’s access request. 

3.  A  CCP  shall  apply  to  economically  equivalent  contracts  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  the 
same  margin  and  collateral  methodologies,  irrespective  of  where  the  contracts  are  traded.  A 
CCP shall subject the clearing of an economically equivalent contract referred to in paragraph 

EN 

351 

EN 

 

 

 

1  to  the  adoption  of  changes  to  the  CCP’s  risk  models  and  parameters,  only  if  necessary  in 
order  to  mitigate  the  risk  factors  in  relation  to  that  trading  venue  or  the  contracts  traded 
thereon.  Such  changes  shall  be  considered  as  significant  changes  to  the  CCP’s  models  and 
parameters referred to in Articles 28 and 49 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.  

 

Article 13 

Netting of economically equivalent contracts 

1.  A  CCP  shall  apply  to  economically  equivalent  contracts  referred  to  in  Article  12(1)  of 
this  Regulation  the same netting procedures irrespective of where the  contracts  were traded, 
provided  that  any  netting  procedure  it  applies  is  valid  and  enforceable  in  accordance  with 
Directive 98/26/EC and the applicable insolvency law in the relevant Member State.  

2.  A  CCP  considering  that  the  legal  risk  or  the  basis  risk  related  to  a  netting  procedure  it 
applies to an economically equivalent  contract is  not sufficiently mitigated, shall subject the 
clearing of such a contract to the adoption of changes to that netting procedure excluding the 
netting of such contract. Such changes shall be considered as significant changes to the CCP’s 
risk models and parameters referred to in Article 28 and 49 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.  

3.  For  the  purpose  of  paragraph  2,  “basis  risk”  shall  mean  the  risk  arising  from  less  than 
perfectly correlated movements between two or more assets or contracts cleared by the CCP.  

 

Article 14 

Cross-margining of correlated contracts (portfolio margining) 

Where a CCP calculates margins with respect to portfolio margining of financial instruments 
in accordance with Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and Article 27 of Commission 
Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  153/2013 6 ,  the  CCP  shall  apply  its  portfolio  margining 
approach  to  all  relevant  correlated  contracts  irrespective  of  where  the  contracts  are  traded. 
Contracts with a significant and reliable correlation, or an equivalent statistical parameter of 
dependence, shall benefit from the same offsets or reductions.

Notification procedure from the CCP to its competent authority 

Article 15 

Where a CCP applies for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements referred to in 
Article 35(5) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, it shall submit a notification to its competent 
authority in written form, using Form 1 set out in the Annex.  

 

Article 16 

Notification procedure from the competent authority to ESMA and the CCP college 

Relevant competent authorities shall notify ESMA and the CCP college of every decision to 
approve  a  transitional  arrangement  in  accordance  with  Article  35(5)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 in writing without undue delay and no later than one month from the decision, using 
Form 2 set out in the Annex to this Regulation. 

 

Article 17 

Notification procedure from the trading venue to its competent authority regarding the 

initial transitional period  

Where  a  trading  venue  does  not  wish  to  be  bound  by  Article  36  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014, it shall submit a notification to ESMA and its competent authority in written form, 
using Forms 3.1 and 3.2  set out in the Annex to this Regulation. 

 

Article 18 

Notification procedure from the trading venue to its competent authority regarding an 

extension of the transitional period  

Where a trading venue wishes to continue not to be bound by Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 
No  600/2014  for  a  further  thirty  months,  it  shall  submit  a  notification  to  ESMA  and  its 
competent  authority  in  written  form,  using  Forms  4.1  and  4.2  set  out  in  the  Annex  to  this 
Regulation. 

 

Article 19 

Further specifications for the calculation of notional amount for transitional purposes 

1. 
In accordance with Article 36(5) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, a trading venue that 
does not wish to be bound by Article 36 of this Regulation for a period of thirty months from 
the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 shall include in its calculation of its 

EN 

353 

EN 

 

 

 

annual  notional  amount  all  transactions  in  exchange-traded  derivatives  concluded  in  the 
calendar year preceding the application under its rules. 

2.  For  the  purposes  of  calculating  its  annual  notional  amount  for  2016  in  accordance  with 
paragraph  1,  a  trading  venue  shall  use  actual  figures  for  the  period  for  which  they  are 
available.  If  a  trading  venue  has  less  than  12  months  of  2016  data  available,  then  it  shall 
produce an estimated figure for 2016 using the following three inputs: 

(a)  actual data for the longest possible period from the beginning of 2016, including at least 

the first 8 months; 

(b)  actual data for the equivalent period during 2015;  

(c)  actual data for the entire year 2015. 

The estimated figure for 2016 shall be calculated as follows: the inputs referred to in point (a) 
shall be multiplied by the inputs referred to in point (c) and divided by the inputs referred to 
in point (b).   

3.  Where  a  trading  venue  wishes  to  continue  not  to  be  bound  by  Article  36  of  Regulation 
(EU)  No  600/2014  for  a  further  thirty  month  period,  it  shall  include  in  its  calculation  of  its 
annual  notional  amount  all transactions in  exchange-traded derivatives concluded in  each of 
the first two rolling years of the previous thirty month period  under its rules. 

4.  Where there are equally acceptable alternative approaches to calculating notional amount 
for certain types of instruments, but there are notable differences in the values to which these 
calculation methods  give rise, the calculation  which gives the higher value shall be used.  In 
particular  for  derivatives,  such  as  futures  or  options,  including  all  types  of  commodity 
derivatives  which  are  designated  in  units,  the  notional  amount  shall  be  the  full  value  of  the 
derivative’s  underlying  assets  at  the  relevant  price  at  the  time  at  which  the  transaction  is 
concluded.  

 

Article 20 

Approval and verification method by ESMA 

1.  For the purposes of verification in  accordance with Article 36(6)(d) of Regulation (EU) 
No  600/2014,  the  trading  venue  shall  submit  to  ESMA  on  request  all  facts  and  figures  on 
which the calculation is based.  

2.  ESMA shall also consider relevant post-trade data and annual statistics for verification of 
the submitted notional amount figures.  

EN

EN 

 

 

 

3.  ESMA shall decide on the approval of the opt-out within three months after the reception 
of all relevant information for the notification according to either Article 16 or 17, including 
the information specified by Article 18.  

 

Article 21 

Entry into force and application 

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in 
the Official Journal of the European Union. 

It shall apply from 3 January 2017, except Articles 15 to 17, 19 and 20 that shall apply from 1

of [Date] 

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on access 

to benchmarks  

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/20121, and in particular Article 37(4) (a), (b), and (c) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

(4)

 

Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provides for the non-discriminatory access for clearing 
and  trading  between  central  counterparties  (CCPs)  and  trading  venues,  including 
access  to  licences  of  and  information  relating  to  benchmarks  which  are  used  to 
determine  the  value  of  some  financial  instruments  for  trading  and  clearing  purposes. 
Given the variety of different types of benchmarks covered, the information CCPs and 
trading venues need for clearing or trading purposes may vary depending on a number 
of factors, including the relevant financial instrument being traded or cleared and the 
type of benchmark that the financial instrument references.  

Therefore, it is not desirable to have an exhaustive list of the types of information that 
should be provided to CCPs and trading venues by a person with proprietary rights to 
a  benchmark.  CCPs  and  trading  venues  should  be  allowed  to  request  access  to 
information, provided it is required for clearing or trading purposes.  

The diversity of benchmarks and the different uses identified render a one size fits all 
approach  inappropriate  and  a  high  degree  of  harmonisation  on the  content  of  licence 
agreements  unsuitable.  Limiting  the  conditions  under  which  access  is  granted  to 
predetermined terms might therefore be detrimental to all parties. 

A  person  with  proprietary  rights  to  a  benchmark  should  be  able  to  set  different 
conditions  for  different  categories  of  CCPs  and  trading  venues  to  access  its 
benchmarks only where objectively justified, such as in terms of the quantity, scope or 
field of use demanded and applied in a proportionate manner. The different categories

and the criteria defining the different categories of CCPs and trading venues should be 
made publicly available.  

The way a benchmark is assessed as new or not will vary on a case by case basis. The 
person  with  proprietary  rights  to  a  benchmark  should  therefore  demonstrate  in  what 
way  that  benchmark  is  new,  if  that  is  invoked  as  the  reason  for  denying  immediate 
access. Each assessment of a declared new benchmark should consider a combination 
of  various  factors  and  their  appropriate  weightings  and  not  rely  on  a  single  factor  to 
assess  whether  or  not  the  benchmark  meets  the  criteria  specified  in  Regulation  (EU) 
No 600/2014.  

in 

the  short  run, 

Accordingly,  although  the  values  of  two  benchmarks  could  be  highly  correlated, 
particularly 
their  compositions  or  methodology  could  be 
fundamentally  different.  The  long  run  correlation  and  similarities  in  the  composition 
and the methodology of each of the benchmarks should therefore be taken into account 
for assessing whether a benchmark is new. In addition to the factors laid down in this 
Regulation,  a  person  with  proprietary  rights  to  a  benchmark  should  also  take  into 
account  additional factors that are specific to  the type of benchmark concerned.)  For 
commodity  benchmarks  other  factors  should  be  assessed,  including  whether  the 
relevant  benchmarks  are  based  on  different  underlying  commodities  and  different 
delivery locations. 

Certain  benchmarks  release  a  new  series  on  a  periodic  basis,  such  as  credit  default 
swaps  (CDS)  benchmarks.  In  those  cases,  the  newly  released  benchmark  is  a 
continuation  of  the  previous  series  and  should  therefore  not  be  considered  a  new 
benchmark. 

The requirements in respect of non-discriminatory access to and obligation to licence 
benchmarks set out in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 apply from 3 January 2019. To 
ensure  consistency  and  legal  certainty,  this  Regulation  should  apply  from  the  same 
date. 

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council2,

EN 

 

 

 

(c)  historical benchmark values where the person with proprietary rights to the benchmark 

maintains such information. 

5. 
In respect of composition, methodology and pricing, the information provided shall allow 
CCPs and trading venues to understand how each benchmark value is created, and the actual 
methodology  used  to  make  the  benchmark’s  values.  Relevant  information  in  respect  of 
composition, methodology and pricing shall at least include:  

(a)  the definitions for all key terms used in relation to the benchmark; 

(b)  the rationale for adopting a methodology and procedures for the review and approval of 

the methodology; 

(c)  the criteria and procedures used to determine the benchmark, including a description of 
the input data, the priority given to different types of input data, the use of any models 
or  methods  of  extrapolation  and  any  procedure  for  rebalancing  the  constituents  of  a 
benchmark;  

(d)  the  controls  and  rules  that  govern  any  exercise  of  discretion  or  judgement,  to  ensure 

consistency in the use of such discretion or judgment; 

(e)  the  procedures  which  govern  benchmark  determination  in  periods  of  stress,  or  periods 
where  transaction-data  sources  may  be  insufficient,  inaccurate  or  unreliable  and  the 
potential limitations of the benchmark in such periods; 

(f)  the hours during which the benchmark is calculated; 

(g)  the  procedures  which  govern  the  benchmark’s  rebalancing  methodology  and  the 

resulting weightings of the constituents of the benchmark; 

(h)  the  procedures  for  dealing  with  errors  in  input  data,  or  the  benchmark  determination, 

including when a re-determination of the benchmark may be required; 

(i) 

information  regarding  the  frequency  for  any  internal  reviews  and  approvals  of  the 
composition  and  methodology  and,  where  applicable,  information  regarding  the 
procedures and frequency for external review of the composition and methodology. 

 

Article 2 

General conditions for the information through licensing to be made available to CCPs 

and trading venues 

1.  A  person  with  proprietary  rights  to  a  benchmark  shall  make  available  all  relevant 
information referred to in Article 1 requested by CCPs and trading venues through licensing 
without undue delay, either on a one-off basis, including amendments to previously supplied 

EN 

363 

EN 

 

 

 

information,  or  on  a  continuous  or  periodic  basis,  depending  on  the  type  of  information 
concerned.  

2.  A person with proprietary rights to a benchmark shall provide all relevant information to 
all  CCPs  and  trading  venues  through  licensing  on  the  same  timescales  and  under  the  same 
conditions, unless different conditions can be objectively justified. 

3. 
If,  and  for  as  long  as,  a  person  with  proprietary  rights  to  a  benchmark  can  demonstrate 
that certain information is available publicly or through other commercial means to CCPs and 
trading  venues,  provided  such  information  is  reliable  and  timely,  it  need  not  supply  that 
information through licensing. 

 

Article 3 

Differentiation and non-discrimination 

1.  Where  a  person  with  proprietary  rights  to  a  benchmark  sets,  in  accordance  with  Article 
37(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, different conditions, including fees and the conditions 
for  paying  them,  those  conditions  shall  apply  in  a  manner  specific  to  each  category  of

1.  When establishing whether a new benchmark meets the cumulative criteria in accordance 
with  paragraphs  2(a)  and  (b)  of  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014,  a  person  with 
proprietary rights to a benchmark shall take the following standards  into account  

(a)  whether contracts based on the more recent benchmark are not capable of being netted 
nor  substantially  offset  with  contracts  based  on  the  relevant  existing  benchmark  by  a 
CCP; 

(b)  whether the regions and industry sectors covered by the relevant benchmarks are not the 

same, nor similar;

account: 

(a)  whether the relevant benchmarks are not based on the same underlying commodities;

3. 
In  addition  to  the  standards  specified  in  paragraph  1  and  2,  a  person  with  proprietary 
rights  to  a  benchmark  shall  also  take  into  account  other  standards  specific  to  the  types  of 
benchmarks being assessed, as appropriate.

supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 
Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the admission of 

financial instruments to trading on regulated markets 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 51(6) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

Transferable securities should only be considered freely negotiable if before admission 
to trading no restrictions exist which prevent the transfer of those securities in a way 
that would disturb creating a fair, orderly and efficient market.  

For the admission to trading on a regulated market of a transferable security as defined 
in  Directive  2014/65/EU,  in  the  case  of  a  security  within  the  meaning  of  Directive 
2003/71/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 2 ,  there  needs  to  be 
sufficient  information  publicly  available  so  as  to  enable  to  value  that  financial 
instrument for it to be traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner. In addition, in the 
case  of  shares  an  adequate  number  should  be  available  for  distribution  to  the  public 
and for securitised derivatives suitable settlement and delivery arrangements should be 
in place. 

(3)

 

Transferable securities which fulfil the requirements for admission to an official list in 
accordance  with  Directive  2001/34/EC  should  be  considered  freely  negotiable  and 
capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner3.

The  admission  to  trading  on  a  regulated  market  of  units  issued  by  undertakings  for 
collective investment in transferable securities or alternative investment funds should 
not  allow  the  avoidance  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  Directive  2009/65/EC  of  the 
European Parliament and of the Council4 or of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European 
Parliament and of the Council5. Therefore, it is necessary for an operator of a regulated 
market  to  verify  that  the  units  it  admits  to  trading  stem  from  a  collective  investment 
scheme  that  complies  with  the  relevant  sectoral  legislation.  In  the  case  of  exchange-
traded  funds,  it  is  necessary  for  the  operator  of  a  regulated  market  to  ensure  that 
adequate redemption arrangements for investors are in place at all times. 

The admission to trading on a regulated market of derivative instruments referred to in 
points (4) to (10) of Sections C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU should take into 
account  whether  there  is  sufficient  information  available  for  the  pricing  of  the 
derivative as well as the underlying, and in the case of physically settled contracts, the 
existence of appropriate settlement and delivery procedures. 

Any emission allowance within the meaning of point (11) of Section C of Annex I to 
Directive  2014/65/EU  recognised  for  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Directive 
2003/87/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council6 should  be  eligible  for 
admission  to  trading  on  a  regulated  market  and  no  further  requirements  should  be 
imposed in this Regulation 

Arrangements by regulated markets in relation to verifying the compliance of issuers 
with obligations under Union law and in relation to facilitating access to information 
which  has  been  made  public  under  Union  law  should  cover  the  obligations  in 
Regulation  (EU)  No  596/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 7 , 
Directive 2003/71/EC and Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of 
the  Council 8  as  these  pieces  of  legislation  contain  the  core  and  most  important 
obligation for issuers after the initial admission to trading on a regulated market.

Regulated  markets  should  have  a  policy  for  verifying  the  compliance  of  issuers  of 
transferable  securities  with  obligations  under  Union  law  which  should  be  accessible 
for  issuers  and  the  public.  The  policy  should  ensure  that  compliance  checks  are 
efficient  and  issuers  should  be  made  aware  of  their  obligations  by  the  regulated 
market.  

Regulated  markets  should  facilitate  access  to  information  published  under  the 
conditions  established  by  Union  law  available  to  members  and  participants  via 
arrangements that provide for easy, fair and non-discriminatory access for all members

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/.. 

of [date] 

supplementing Directive (EU) No 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament 

and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the 

suspension and removal of financial instruments from trading 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular the tenth subparagraph of Article 32(2) and the tenth 
subparagraph of Article 52(2) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

The objective of a suspension or removal from trading of a financial instrument will in 
some  cases  not  be  achieved  unless  a  derivative  of  a  type  referred  to  in  points  (4)  to 
(10)  of  Section  C  of  Annex  I  to  Directive  2014/65/EU  relating  or  referenced  to  that 
financial instrument is also suspended or removed from trading.  

In  determining  cases  where  the  connection  is  such  that  it  is  necessary  to  suspend  or 
remove related derivatives, the strength of the connection between the derivative and 
the  financial  instrument  that  is  suspended  or  removed  from  trading  should  be 
considered.  In  this  respect,  a  distinction  should  be  made  between  a  derivative  for 
which the formation of its price or value is dependent on the  price or value of a sole 
underlying  financial  instrument,  and  derivatives  for  which  the  price  or  value  is 
dependent  on  multiple  price  inputs,  for  instance,  derivatives  related  to  an  index  or  a 
basket of financial instruments.  

The  inability  to  correctly  price  related  derivatives,  leading  to  a  disorderly  market, 
should  be  considered  the  strongest  for  the  cases  where  the  derivative  is  related  or 
referenced  to  only  one  financial  instrument.  When  the  derivative  is  related  or 
referenced  to  a  basket  of  financial  instruments  or  an  index  of  which  the  suspended 
financial instrument is only one part, the ability of market participants to determine the 
correct  price  would  be  less  affected.  Thus  the  characteristics  of  the  connection 

                                                 

1 OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349.

between the derivative and the underlying should be taken into account in considering 
the overall objective of the suspension or removal.  

It  should be taken into account  that a market  operator has to  ensure fair, orderly and 
efficient trading in its market. Outside the scope of this Regulation, a market operator 
will need to make an assessment of whether the suspension or removal from trading of 
the  underlying  financial  instrument  endangers  the  fair  and  orderly  trading  of  the 
derivative  in  its  trading  venue,  including  taking  appropriate  action  such  as  the 
suspension or removal of related derivatives on its own initiative.  

The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  specifying 
the  suspensions  and  removals  on  different  types  of  trading  venues.  To  ensure 
coherence  between  those  provisions,  which  should  enter  into  force  at  the  same  time, 
and to facilitate a comprehensive view for stakeholders and, in particular, those subject 
to the obligations it is necessary to consolidate the regulatory technical standards in a 
single Regulation. 

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 2 applies  from  3  January 
2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from the 
same date.   

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council3.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 

Having  regard to  Directive 2014/65/EU of 15 May 2014 of the European Parliament  and of 
the  Council  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1 and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 18(11) thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

It  is  important  to  recognise  the  need  for  competent  authorities  to  receive  complete 
information  about  the  purpose,  structure  and  organisation  of  multilateral  trading 
facilities (MTFs) and organised trading facilities (OTFs) that they will be required to 
supervise in order to ensure the efficient and orderly functioning of financial markets. 

This  information  should  build  upon  the  information  an  investment  firm  or  market 
operator would be required to provide as part of the general authorisation requirements 
under  Directive  2014/65/EU.  It  should  focus  upon  the  specific  functionality  of  the 
trading  system  so  as  to  enable  competent  authorities  to  assess  whether  the  system 
satisfies  the  definition  of  an  MTF  or  OTF  and  to  assess  its  compliance  with  the 
particular,  venue-orientated  requirements  of  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation 
(EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council2. The requirement 
for  a  detailed  description  should  not  affect  the  duty  of  an  investment  firm  or  market 
operator  to  provide  other  information  to  its  competent  authority  as  required  under 
Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014,  or  the  rights  of  competent 
authorities to request other information as part of their on-going supervision of trading 
venues.

The 
information  should  ensure  a  uniform  application  of  collecting  detailed 
descriptions  of  the  functioning  of  the  MTF  or  OTF  under  Directive  2014/65/EU  and 
achieve an efficient processing of information for existing MTFs already operating in 
accordance  with  national  authorisation  at  the  point  the  requirement  of  submitting  a 
detailed description comes into force. 

Since SME growth markets are distinguished from other MTFs in that they are subject 
to  additional  rules,  it  is  necessary  that  SME  growth  markets  shall  provide  additional 
information. 

Since OTFs are distinguished from MTFs in that the trading process may involve the 
use of discretionary rules by the operator and because the operator of an OTF will owe 
client  facing  responsibilities  to  users  of  the  system,  OTFs  should  provide  additional 
information. 

To ensure the efficient processing of the information required it should be provided in 
electronic format.  

To  facilitate  the  publication  by  the  European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority 
(ESMA)  of  the  list  of  all  MTFs  and  OTFs  in  the  Union  with  information  on  the 
services  they  provide  and  the  unique  code  identifying  them,  a  standard  template  for 
that information should be used.  

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No

supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 

Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for criteria to 

establish when an activity is considered to be ancillary to the main business 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May 2014 on markets in financial instruments1, and in particular Article 2(4) thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

The  assessment  whether  persons  are  dealing  on  own  account  or  are  providing 
investment  services  in  commodity  derivatives,  emission  allowances  and  derivatives 
thereof  in  the  Union  as  an  activity  ancillary  to  their  main  business  should  be 
performed at a group level. In line with Article 2(11) of Directive 2013/34/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council2, a group is considered to comprise the parent 
undertaking and  all its subsidiary undertakings and includes entities domiciled in  the 
Union and in third countries regardless of whether the group is headquartered inside or 
outside the Union.  

The assessment should be performed in the form of two tests, which are both based on 
the trading activity of the persons within the group and should be calculated on a per-
asset-class basis. The first test should determine whether the persons within the group 
are large participants relative to the size of the financial market in that asset class and 
as a consequence should be required to obtain authorisation as an investment firm. The 
second  test  should  determine  whether  the  persons  within  the  group  trade  on  own 
account or provide investment services in commodity derivatives, emission allowances 
or derivatives thereof to such a large extent relative to the main business of the group 
that  those  activities  cannot  be  considered  to  be  ancillary  at  group  level  and  that 
therefore the persons should be required to obtain authorisation as an investment firm.

Directive  2006/43/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  and  repealing  Council  Directives

Where persons within the group operate simultaneously in different asset classes and 
exceed  the  threshold  in  relation  to  one  asset  class,  it  should  be  subject  to  Directive 
2014/65/EU for all commodity classes.    

The  first  test  compares  the  level  of  a  person’s  trading  activity  against  the  overall 
trading activity in the Union on an asset class basis to determine the person’s market 
share. The size of the trading activity should be determined by deducting the sum  of 
the  volume  of  the  transactions  referred  to  in  points  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of  the  fifth 
subparagraph  of  Article  2(4),  fifth  subparagraph  ('privileged  transactions')  from  the 
volume of the overall trading activity undertaken by the group.  

The volume of the trading activity should be determined by the gross notional value of 
contracts  in  commodity  derivatives,  emission  allowances  and  derivatives  thereof  on 
the basis of a rolling annual average of the preceding three calendar years. The overall 
market  size  should  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  trading  activity  undertaken  in  the 
Union  in  relation  to  each  asset  class:  metals,  oil,  coal,  emission  allowances  and 
derivatives thereof, gas, power, agricultural products and other commodities. Trading 
activity comprises trading in contracts traded ouside trading venues to which a person 
that  is  located  in  a  Member  State  is  party  and  contracts  that  are  traded  on  trading 
venues located in a Member State.  

As  commodity  markets  differ  significantly  in  terms  of  size,  number  of  market 
participants, level of liquidity and other characteristics, different thresholds shall apply 
for different asset classes in relation to the test on the size of the trading activity.  

The  second  test  assesses  the  size  of  the  trading  activity,  excluding  privileged 
transactions and transactions executed by authorised entities of the group, undertaken 
by the group in all asset classes (the numerator) against the size of the overall trading 
activity,  including  privileged  transactions  and  transactions  executed  by  authorised 
entities  of  the  group,  undertaken  by  the  group  in  total  for  all  asset  classes  (the 
denominator).  

The  size  of  the  trading  activity  as  used  in  the  second  test,  including  privileged 
transactions  and  transactions  executed  by  authorised  entities,  is  taken  as  a  proxy  for 
the commercial activity that the person or group does as its main business. This proxy 
should  be  easy  and  cost  efficient  for  persons  to  apply  as  it  builds  on  data  already 
required  to  be  collected  for  the  first  test  while  at  the  same  time  establishing  a 
meaningful test.  

A  rational  risk-averse  entity,  such  as  a  producer,  processor  or  consumer  of 
commodities,  will  seek  to  hedge  the  volume  of  the  commercial  activity  of  its  main 
business with an equivalent volume of commodity derivatives, emission allowances or 
derivatives  thereof.  Therefore  the  volume  of  turnover  of  commodity  derivatives 
measured in the gross notional value of the underlying, which are purchased or sold is 
an appropriate proxy for the size of the main business of the group. Main business of

(10)

the group that is not related to commodities would not use commodity derivatives as a 
risk-reducing  tool  and  therefore  any  co-existing  trading  in  commodity  derivatives 
would ab initio be speculative and unable to benefit from the ancillary exemption.  

The  second  test  may  inadvertently  capture  persons  with  a  high  proportion  of  trading 
which  is  neither  privileged  transactions  nor  executed  in  an  authorised  entity  of  the 
group but  nevertheless  have a very low level  of trading activity in  total.  IN addition, 
hedging activity  cannot be considere a perfect  proxy for the commercial activity that 
the person or group conducts as its main business as it does not take into account other 
investments  of  commodity  market  participants  in  fixed  assets  unrelated  to  derivative 
markets.  Therefore,  the  second  test  should  not  solely  operate  on  the  basis  of  the 
application  of  this  proxy  but  rather  should  contain  a  backstop  mechanism  which 
recognises that the trading activity undertaken by the persons within the group should 
also  exceed  a  certain  percentage  of  any  of  the  thresholds  set  under  the  first  test  for 
each relevant asset class to be deemed non-ancillary. The higher the percentage of the 
speculative activity within all trading activity, the lower this threshold. Calibrating the 
main business test in this way should ensure that only relevant and sizable participants 
in  European  commodity  derivative  markets  should  be  determined  as  not  conducting 
their activities as ancillary to their main business.  

  The rationale of the ancillary activity tests  is  to  check whether entities not  subject  to 
financial regulation  should be required to  acquire an authorisation  due to the relative 
or  absolute  size  of  their  activity  in  commodity  derivatives,  emission  allowances  and 
derivatives  thereof  The  ancillary  activity  tests  determine  the  size  of  activities  in 
commodity  derivatives,  emission  allowances  and  derivatives  thereof  which  entities 
within a group may carry out without authorisation under Directive 2014/65/EU due to 
those  activities  being  ancillary  to  the  group’s  main  business.  The  group  level 
assessment means that it is appropriate to calculate the size of the ancillary activity of 
the group by using criteria which exclude certain privileged transactions and activity 
carried  out  by  authorised  group  members.  This  is  because  these  transactions  serve 
regulatory  or  commercial  purposes  or  are  otherwise  already  subject  to  appropriate 
supervision.  Without  excluding  the  activity  of  authorised  group  members,  the 
exemption  could  have  the  effect  of  requiring  the  consolidation  of  genuine  ancillary 
activity carried out by unauthorised group members, for example, persons which only 
execute  privileged  transactions,  into  the  trading  activity  of  its  authorised  members 
solely  as  a  result  of  the  size  of  the  supervised  trading  activity  of  those  authorised 
members.  Trading  activity  undertaken  by  an  authorised  entity  of  the  group  should 
therefore  be  excluded  from  the  calculations  of  the  ancillary  activity  undertaken  by 
unauthorised members of the group as it is already appropriately authorised.  

(11)

 

In order to allow for market participants to plan and operate a business in a reasonable 
way and to take into account seasonal patterns of activity, the calculation of the tests 
determining when an activity is considered to be ancillary to the main business should 
be based on a period of three years. Therefore, entities should perform the assessment 
whether  they  breach  one  of  the  two  thresholds  on  an  annual  basis  by  calculating  a 

EN 

396 

EN 

 

 

 

simple  average  of  three  years  on  a  rolling  basis  in  order  to  be  able  to  submit  their 
annual  notification  to  the  competent  authority.  This  obligation  should  be  without 
prejudice to the right of the competent authority to request at any time a report from a 
person about the basis on which that person considers its activity under points (i) and 
(ii) under point (j) of Article 2(4) of Directive 2014/65/EU to be ancillary to its main 
business. 

(12)

  Transactions objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to commercial 
activity  or  treasury  financing  activity  and  intra-group  transactions  should  be 
considered  in  a  way  consistent  with  Regulation  (EU)  No.  648/2012  of  the  European 
Parliament  and  of  the  Council3.  However,  in  relation  to  transactions  in  derivatives 
which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial 
activity  or  treasury  financing  activity  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No 
149/20134 only refers to derivatives not traded on regulated markets while Article 2(4) 
of Directive 2014/65/EU covers derivatives traded on trading venues. Therefore, this 
Regulation  should  also  take  into  account  derivatives  traded  on  regulated  markets  in 
relation to transactions that are deemed to be objectively measurable as reducing risks 
directly related to commercial or treasury financing activity.  

(13)

 

In some circumstances, it may not be possible to hedge a commercial risk by using a 
directly  related  commodity  derivative  contract:  a  contract  with  exactly  the  same 
underlying and settlement date as the risk being covered. In such case, the person may 
use proxy hedging through a closely correlated instrument to cover its exposure such 
as  an  instrument  with  a  different  but  very  close  underlying  in  terms  of  economic 
behaviour.  Additionally,  macro  or  portfolio  hedging  may  be  used  by  persons,  which 
enter  into  commodity  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  a  risk  in  relation  to  their  overall 
risks  or  the  overall  risks  of  the  group.  Those  macro,  portfolio  or  proxy  hedging 
commodity  derivative  contracts  may  constitute  hedging  for  the  purpose  of  this 
Regulation.  

(14)

  When a person applying the ancillary activity test uses portfolio or macro hedging, it 
may  not  be  able  to  establish  a  one-to-one  link  between  a  specific  transaction  in  a 
commodity  derivative  and  a  specific  risk  directly  related  to  the  commercial  and 
treasury  financing  activities  entered  into  to  hedge  it.  The  risks  directly  related  to  the 
commercial and treasury financing activities may be of a complex nature e.g. several 
geographic  markets,  several  products,  time  horizons  or  entities.  The  portfolio  of 
commodity  derivative  contracts  entered  into  to  mitigate  those  risks  may  derive  from

derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 1).

No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  regulatory  technical  standards  on 
indirect  clearing  arrangements,  the  clearing  obligation,  the  public  register,  access  to  a  trading  venue,  non-
financial counterparties, and risk mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives contracts not cleared by a CCP (OJ

complex risk management systems. In such cases the risk management systems should 
prevent non-hedging transactions from being categorised as hedging and provide for a 
sufficiently disaggregate view of the hedging portfolio so that speculative components 
are  identified  and  counted  towards  the  thresholds.  Positions  should  not  qualify  as 
reducing risks related to commercial activity solely on the grounds that they form par 
of a risk-reducing portfolio on an overall basis.  

(15)

  A  risk  may  evolve  over  time  and,  in  order  to  adapt  to  the  evolution  of  the  risk, 
commodity  derivatives  initially  executed  for  reducing  risk  related  to  commercial 
activity,  may  have  to  be  offset  through  the  use  of  additional  commodity  derivative 
contracts.  As  a  result,  hedging  of  a  risk  may  be  achieved  by  a  combination  of 
commodity  derivative  contracts  including  offsetting  commodity  derivative  contracts 
that close out those commodity derivative contracts that have become unrelated to the 
commercial risk.  Additionally the evolution of a risk that has been addressed by the 
entering into of a position in a commodity derivative for the purpose of reducing that 
risk should not subsequently give rise to the re-evaluation of that position as being not 
a privileged transaction ab initio.

Main business threshold 

1.  Ancillary activities shall be considered to constitute a minority of activities at group level 
compared to the main business of the group where the size of the trading activities calculated 
in accordance with paragraph 34 does not account for more than 10% of the total size of the 
trading activity of the group calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.   

2.  By way of derogation from paragraph 1,  

(a)  where  the  size  of  the  trading  activities  calculated  in  accordance  with  paragraph  34 
accounts for more than 10% but less than 50% of the total size of the trading activity of 
the  group  calculated  in  accordance  with  paragraph  4,  ancillary  activities  shall  be 
considered to constitute a minority of activities at group level only where the size of the 
trading activity for each of the asset classes referred to in Article 2(1) accounts for less 
than 50% of the threshold established by Article 2(1) of the overall market’s size in the 
relevant asset class. 

(b)  where  the  size  of  the  trading  activity  calculated  in  accordance  with  paragraph  34 
accounts for equal to or more than 50% of the size of the trading activity calculated in 
accordance  with  paragraph  4,  ancillary  activities  shall  be  considered  to  constitute  a 
minority of activities at group level only where the size of the trading activity for each 
of the asset classes referred to in Article 2(1) accounts for less than 20% of the threshold 
established by Article 2(1) of the overall market’s size in the relevant asset class. 

3.  The  size  of  the  activities  referred  to  in  points  (i)  and  (ii)  of  Article  2(1)(j)  of  Directive 
2014/65/EU  undertaken  by  persons  within  a  group  shall  be  calculated  by  aggregating  the 
trading  activity  undertaken  by  those  persons  in  all  of  the  asset  classes  referred  to  in  Article 
2(1) in accordance with the same calculation criteria as that referred to in Article 2(2).

Article 5 

Transactions qualifying as reducing risks  

1.  For  the  purposes  of  the  fifth  subparagraph  of  point  (b)  of  Article  2(4),  of  Directive 
2014/65/EU, a transaction in derivatives shall be considered to reduce objectively measurable 
risks  directly  relating  to  commercial  activity  or  treasury  financing  activity  when  one  of  the 
following criteria are met: 

(a)  it  reduces  the  risks  arising  from  the  potential  change  in  the  value  of  assets,  services, 
inputs, products, commodities or liabilities that the person or its group owns, produces, 
manufactures,  processes,  provides,  purchases,  merchandises,  leases,  sells,  or  incurs  or 
reasonably  anticipates  owning,  producing,  manufacturing,  processing,  providing, 
purchasing,  merchandising,  leasing,  selling  or  incurring  in  the  normal  course  of  its 
business; 

(b)  it  covers  the  risks  arising  from  the  potential  indirect  impact  on  the  value  of  assets, 
services,  inputs,  products,  commodities  or  liabilities  referred  to  in  point  (a),  resulting 
from fluctuation of interest rates, inflation rates, foreign exchange rates or credit risk;  

(c)  it  qualifies  as  a  hedging  contract  pursuant  to  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards adopted in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the 
European Parliament and Council.   

2.  For the purposes of paragraph 1, a qualifying risk-reducing transaction taken on its own 
or in combination with other derivatives is one for which the non-financial entity:

(a)  describes the following in its internal policies: 

(i)  the  types  of  commodity  derivative  contracts  included  in  the  portfolios  used  to 

reduce risks directly relating to commercial activity and their eligibility criteria; 

(ii)  the link between the portfolio and the risks that the portfolio is mitigating; 

(iii) the measures adopted to  ensure that the transactions concerning those contracts 
serve  no  other  purpose  than  covering  risks  directly  related  to  the  commercial 
activities of the non-financial entity, and that any transaction serving a different 
purpose can be clearly identified;  

(b)  is able to provide a sufficiently disaggregate view of the portfolios in terms of class of 
commodity  derivative,  underlying  commodity,  time  horizon  and  any  other  relevant 
factors.

supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 
Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the application of 

position limits to commodity derivatives 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments 1,  and  in  particular  Article  57(3)  and  (12) 
thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

In  order  to  ensure  a  harmonised  approach  to  applying  position  limits  to  commodity 
derivatives  in  the  Union,  a  methodology  should  be  specified  for  calculating  those 
limits. The methodology should prevent regulatory arbitrage and promote consistency 
whilst  providing  competent  authorities  with  sufficient  flexibility  to  take  into  account 
the variations among different commodity derivatives markets and the markets in the 
underlying  commodities.  The  methodology  for  calculating  the  limits  should  allow 
competent authorities to balance the objectives of setting limits at a level sufficiently 
low to prevent persons holding positions in those commodity derivatives from abusing 
or  distorting  the  market  against  the  objectives  of  supporting  orderly  pricing  and 
settlement  arrangements,  developing  new  commodity  derivatives  and  enabling 
commodity derivatives to continue to support the functioning of commercial activities 
in the underlying commodity market. 

In  order  to  clearly  identify  a  limited  number  of  concepts  stemming  from  Directive 
2014/65/EU,  as  well  as  to  specify  technical  terms  necessary  for  this  Regulation,  a 
number of terms should be defined to ensure uniform application. 

Long and short positions in  a commodity derivative of market  participants  should be 
netted  off  against  each  other  to  determine  the  effective  size  of  a  position  a  person 
controls  at  any  point  in  time.  The  size  of  a  position  held  through  an  option  contract 
should be calculated on a delta equivalent basis, As this Regulation applies a different

methodology to the calculation of position limits for spot and other months’ contracts, 
such netting should be applied separately to the spot and other months’ positions.  

Directive 2014/65/EU requires that any positions held by other persons on behalf of a 
person  should  be  included  in  the  calculation  of  that  person’s  position  limit  and  for 
position  limits  to  be  applied  at  both  an  entity  level  and  at  a  group  level  and  it  is 
therefore  necessary  to  aggregate  positions  at  a  group  level.  It  is  appropriate  to  only 
provide for aggregation at the group level if a parent undertaking can control the use of 
positions.  Accordingly,  parent  undertakings  should  aggregate  positions  held  by  their 
subsidiaries with any positions that the parent entity holds directly, in addition to the 
subsidiaries  aggregating  their  own  positions.  Such  aggregation  can  lead  to  positions 
calculated at the level of the parent undertaking which are larger or, due to a netting of 
long  and  short  positions  held  by  different  subsidiaries,  lower  than  at  individual 
subsidiary  level.  Positions  should  not  be  aggregated  at  the  level  of  the  parent 
undertaking if the positions are held by collective investment undertakings which hold 
those  positions  on  behalf  of  their  investors  rather  than  on  behalf  of  their  parent 
undertakings  in  cases  where  the  parent  undertaking  cannot  control  the  use  of  those 
positions for its own benefit.  

The  concept  of  the  same  commodity  derivative  should  establish  a  demanding 
threshold  to  prevent  persons  from  inappropriately  netting  positions  across  dissimilar 
commodity  derivatives  in  order  to  circumvent  and  weaken  the  robustness  of  the 
position limit on the principal commodity derivative contract. This should not prevent 
competent  authorities  from  setting  similar  position  limits  for  similar  commodity 
derivative  contracts  under  the  coordination  of  the  European  Securities  and  Markets 
Authority  (ESMA).  Commodity  derivatives  should  only  be  considered  as  trading  in 
significant volume on a trading venue if they exceed the  liquidity threshold specified 
in this Regulation for a sufficient period of time.   

(6)

  Where  an  over-the-counter  (OTC)  contract  is  valued  on  the  same  underlying 
commodity  that  is  deliverable  at  the  same  location  and  with  the  same  contractual 
conditions  such  as  date  of  delivery  and  if  it  is  having  a  highly  correlated  economic 
outcome  to  a  contract  traded  on  a  trading  venue,  it  should  be  deemed  economically 
equivalent. Differences in post trade risk management arrangements, such as clearing 
arrangements,  should  not  be  barriers  to  declaring  such  contracts  as  economically 
equivalent. In order to prevent inappropriate netting of potentially dominant positions 
traded on a trading venue by the use of bilateral arrangements in OTC contracts and to 
ensure an efficient operation of the position limits regime in practice it is necessary for 
commodity  derivatives  traded  OTC  to  be  considered  economically  equivalent  to 
trading venue contracts only in limited circumstances. To deter avoidance of position 
limits  and  to  enhance  the  integrity  of  the  position  limit  regime  it  is  necessary  that  a 
definition  of  an  economically  equivalent  OTC  contract  is  narrowly  framed  so  that  it 
does not permit a person to net an OTC position against multiple other positions or to 
exercise discretion in the choice of positions against which it is netted.

In  order  to  establish  which  positions  in  commodity  derivatives  are  objectively 
measurable  as  reducing  risks  directly  relating  to  commercial  activity,  certain  criteria 
should  be  provided,  including  the  use  of  the  accounting  definition  of  a  hedging 
contract  based  on  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  rules.  That 
accounting  definition  should  be  also  available  to  non-financial  entities  even  though 
they do not apply IFRS rules at an entity level. 

Additionally, non-financial entities should be able to use risk management techniques 
to  mitigate  their  overall  risks  arising  from  their  commercial  activity  or  that  of  their 
group, including risks arising from several geographic markets, several products, time 
horizons  or  entities  ('macro  or  portfolio  hedging').    When  a  non-financial  entity  uses 
macro or portfolio hedging, it may not be able to establish a one-to-one link between a 
specific  position  in  a  commodity  derivative  and  a  specific  risk  arising  from  the 
commercial  activity  that  the  commodity  derivative  is  intended  to  hedge.  A  non-
financial  entity  may  also  use  a  non-equivalent  commodity  derivative  to  hedge  a 
specific  risk  arising  from  commercial  activity  where  an  identical  commodity 
derivative  is  not  available  or  where  a  more  closely  correlated  commodity  derivative 
does  not  have  sufficient  liquidity  (‘proxy  hedging’).  In  such  cases,  risk  management 
policies  and  systems  should  be  able  to  prevent  non-hedging  transactions  from  being 
categorised  as  hedging  and  should  be  able  to  provide  for  a  sufficiently  disaggregate 
view  of  the  hedging  portfolio  so  that  speculative  components  are  identified  and 
counted  towards  the  position  limits.  Positions  should  not  qualify  as  reducing  risks 
related  to  commercial  activity  solely  on  the  grounds  that  they  have  been  included  as 
part of a risk-reducing portfolio on an overall basis.  

A  risk  may  evolve  over  time  and,  in  order  to  adapt  to  the  evolution  of  the  risk, 
commodity  derivatives  initially  executed  for  reducing  risk  related  to  commercial 
activity,  may  have  to  be  offset  throught  the  use  of  additional  commodity  derivative 
contracts  that  close  out  those  commodity  derivative  contracts  that  have  become 
unrelated  to  the  commercial  risk.  Additionally,  the  evolution  of  a  risk  that  has  been 
addressed by the entering into of a position in a commodity derivative for the purpose 
of reducing risk should not subsequently give risk to the re-evaluation of that position 
as not being a privileged transaction ab initio.  

  Non-financial entities should be able to apply for the exemption in relation to hedging 
of  commercial  activities  before  entering  into  a  position.  The  application  should  give 
the competent  authority  a clear and  concise overview of the commercial  activities of 
the  non-financial  entity  in  respect  of  an  underlying  commodity,  the  associated  risks 
and  how  commodity  derivatives  are  utilised  to  mitigate  those  risks.  Position  limits 
apply at all times and should the exemption ultimately not be granted by the competent 
authority,  the  non-financial  entitiy  should  reduce  any  position  in  excess  of  a  limit 
accordingly and may face supervisory measures in respect of a breach of a limit. Non-
financial  entities  should  re-assess  their  activities  periodically  to  ensure  that  the 
continued application of the exemption is justified.

  The  spot-month  period,  which  is  the  time  period  immediately  before  delivery  at 
expiry,  is  specific  to  each  commodity  derivative  and  may  not  correspond  to  exactly 
one month. Spot month contracts should therefore refer to the contract that is the next 
contract  in  that  commodity  derivative  to  mature.  Restricting  the  positions  a  person 
may hold in the period during which delivery of the physical commodity is to be made 
limits the quantity of the underlying deliverable supply each person may make or take 
delivery of, thereby preventing the accumulation of dominant positions by individuals 
which  may  enable  them  to  squeeze  the  market  through  restricting  access  to  the 
commodity. The standard baseline for the spot month position limit for both physically 
and cash settled commodity derivatives should therefore be computed as a percentage 
of the deliverable supply estimate. Competent authorities should be able to implement 
a schedule of decreasing position limits ranging from the point in time when a contract 
becomes  a  spot  month  contract  until  maturity  in  order  to  more  precisely  ensure  that 
position  limits  are  adequately  set  throughout  the  spot  month  period  and  to  ensure 
orderly settlement.  

(12)

  The  other  months’  position  limit  is  applied  across  all  maturities  other  than  the  spot 
month. The standard baseline for the other months’ position limits for both physically 
and  cash  settled  commodity  derivatives  should  be  computed  as  a  percentage  of  the 
total  open  interest.  The  distribution  of  positions  across  the  other  months’  of  a 
commodity contract is often concentrated in the months closest to maturity. Therefore 
total open interest provides a more appropriate baseline for setting position limits than 
using a figure averaged across all maturities. 

(13)

  The standard baseline of 25% of deliverable supply and of open interest has been set 
with reference to the experience of other markets and other jurisdictions.  The baseline 
should be adjusted by competent authorities to enable it to be reduced by a maximum 
of  20%  and  to  be  increased  by  a  maximum  of  10%  should  the  characteristics  of  the 
market  require  it,  such  as  an  absence  of  market  participants,  in  order  to  support  the 
orderly  settlement  and  functioning  of  the  contract  and  its  underlying  market. 
Competent authorities should ensure that an adjustment downwards of the baseline is 
effected whenever it is necessary to prevent dominant positions and to support orderly 
pricing  in  the  commodity  derivative  and  in  the  underlying  commodity.  The  range 
reflects that Directive 2014/65/EU covers a wider range of commodity derivatives and 
markets than other markets and jurisdictions. 

(14)

  The definition of commodity derivative under Article 2(1)(30) of Regulation 600/2014 
of  the  European  Parliament  and  the  Council 2 is  broad,  comprising  also  securitised 
derivatives and cash settled derivatives which do not have a tangible underlying such 
as climatic variables. For securitised derivatives the concept of spot and other months’

does  not  apply.  For  derivatives  without  a  tangible  underlying  the  deliverable  supply 
cannot be used to establish a position limit. Therefore competent authorities should be 
able  to  enhance  or  adjust  the  methodologies  to  determine  position  limits  for  these 
commodity derivatives based on different parameters like number of securities issued 
or the use of open interest also for the spot month. 

  Certain  commodity  derivatives,  in  particular  for  power  and  gas,  provide  that  the 
underlying be delivered constantly over a specified period of time such as day, month 
or  year.  Moreover,  certain  contracts  with  longer  delivery  periods  such  as  year  or 
quarter  may  be  automatically  substituted  by  related  contracts  of  shorter  delivery 
periods such as quarter or month (cascadation). In these cases, a spot month position 
limit for the contract to be substituted prior to delivery would be inappropriate, as such 
limit  would  not  cover  the  expiry  and  physical  delivery  or  cash  settlement  of  the 
contract.  To  the  extent  that  delivery  periods  of  contracts  for  the  same  underlying 
overlap,  a  single  position  limit  should  apply  to  all  the  related  contracts  in  order  to 
properly take into account the positions across those contracts which may potentially 
be  delivered.  To  facilitate  this,  related  contracts  should  be  measured  in  units  of  the 
underlying and aggregated and netted accordingly.  

(16)

  The competent authority should assess whether the factors listed under paragraph 3 of 
Article 57 of Directive 2014/65/EU necessitate adjustment of the baseline in order to 
set the final level of the position limit. The assessment should take into account these 
factors  as  relevant  for  the  particular  commodity  derivative  in  question.  The 
methodologies should provide a direction of how to set the limit without taking away 
the ultimate decision on an appropriate position limit for a commodity derivative from 
the  competent  authority  in  order  to  prevent  market  abuse.  The  factors  should  give 
important  indications  to  the  competent  authorities  and  also  to  ESMA  to  facilitate 
forming its opinions and ensuring an adequate alignment of position limits across the 
Union.   

(17)

  Position  limits  should  not  create  barriers  to  the  development  of  new  commodity 
derivatives  and  should  not  prevent  less  liquid  sections  of  the  commodity  derivative 
markets from working adequately. Competent  authorities should take into account  in 
applying  the  methodology  the  time  required  to  develop  and  attract  liquidity  to  both 
new and existing commodity derivatives and, in particular, for commodity derivatives 
that may support risk management in bespoke or immature markets or seek to develop 
new hedging arrangements in new commodities. Given the broad range of markets and 
commodities  to  which  the  position  limits  regime  applies,  there  is  no  single  and 
predetermined  time  period  which  adequately  captures  the  shift  from  a  commodity 
derivative  contract  being  new  to  being  established.  Equally,  there  are  many 
commodity  derivative  contracts  which  may  never  attract  sufficient  participants  or 
liquidity  to  enable  the  effective  application  of  position  limits  without  the  risk  of 
participants  regularly  and  inadvertently  breaching  the  limit  and  consequently 
disrupting  the  pricing  and  settlement  of  those  commodity  derivatives.  In  order  to 
address  these risks to  the efficient functioning  of markets, the methodology provides 

EN 

408 

EN 

 

 

 

for  a  tiered  approach  whereby  the  position  limit  for  the  spot  month  and  for  other 
months  is  set  at  a  fixed  level  of  2,500  lots  or  securities  in  issue  until  a  threshold  is 
exceeded, after which it is calculated under the standard methoology.  

(18)

  The  number,  composition,  and  the  role  of  market  participants  in  a  commodity 
derivative  can  influence  the  nature  and  the  size  of  positions  that  certain  market 
participants  hold  in  the  market.  For  some  commodity  derivatives,  certain  market 
participants  might  hold  a  large  position  which  reflects  their  role  in  the  buying  and 
selling of,  and the delivery  of, the commodity  when they are on the opposite side of 
the  market  to  the  majority  of  other  market  participants  providing  liquidity  or  risk 
management services for the underlying commodity market. 

(19)

  The  supply,  use,  access  to,  and  availability  of  the  underlying  commodity  are 
characteristics of the underlying commodity market. Through the assessment of more 
granular  components  of  these  characteristics,  such  as  perishability  of  the  commodity 
and method of transportation, the competent authority can determine the flexibility of 
the market and adjust position limits appropriately.

venues  or  in  economically  equivalent  OTC  contracts  pursuant  to  Article  6  qualifies  as 
reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activities of that non-financial entity where 
by itself, or in combination with other derivatives in accordance with paragraph 2 ('position in 
a portfolio of commodity derivatives'), the position meets one of the following criteria: 

(a)  it  reduces  the  risks  arising  from  the  potential  change  in  the  value  of  assets,  services, 
inputs,  products,  commodities  or  liabilities  that  the  non-financial  entity  or  its  group 
owns,  produces,  manufactures,  processes,  provides,  purchases,  merchandises,  leases, 
sells, or incurs or reasonably anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, 
providing, purchasing, merchandising, leasing, selling or incurring in the normal course 
of its business;

(i)  the  types  of  commodity  derivative  contracts  included  in  the  portfolios  used  to 

reduce risks directly relating to commercial activity and their eligibility criteria; 

(ii)  the link between the portfolio and the risks that the portfolio is mitigating; 

(iii) the  measures  adopted  to  ensure  that  the  positions  concerning  those  contracts 
serve  no  other  purpose  than  covering  risks  directly  related  to  the  commercial 
activities  of  the  non-financial  entity,  and  that  any  position  serving  a  different 
purpose can be clearly identified;  

(b)  is able to provide a sufficiently disaggregated view of the portfolios in terms of class of 
commodity  derivative,  underlying  commodity,  time  horizon  and  any  other  relevant 
factors.

in  a commodity derivative by  calculating 25% of the deliverable supply  for that commodity 
derivative. 

2.  The baseline figure shall be specified in lots which shall be the unit of trading used by the 
trading venue on which the commodity derivative trades representing a standardised quantity 
of the underlying commodity. 

3.  Where  a  competent  authority  establishes  different  position  limits  for  different  times 
within  the  spot  month  period,  those  position  limits  shall  decrease  on  an  incremental  basis 
towards  the  maturity  of  the  commodity  derivative  and  shall  take  into  account  the  position 
management arrangements of the trading venue.  

 

Article 10 

(Article 57(3) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Deliverable supply 

1.  Competent  authorities  shall  calculate  the  deliverable  supply  for  a  commodity  derivative 
by identifying the quantity of the underlying commodity that fulfils the following conditions: 

(a)  it meets the delivery specifications of the commodity derivative; 

(b)  it  is  expected  to  be  readily  available  for  settling  that  type  of  commodity  derivative 
contract  traded  on  the  trading  venue  at  the  contract's  delivery  points  during  the  spot 
month delivery period   as specified by the trading venue. 

2.  Competent authorities shall determine the deliverable supply for a commodity deriviative 
referred  to  in  paragraph  1  by  reference  to  the  average  monthly  amount  of  the  underlying 
commodity  available  for  delivery  over  the  one  year  period  immediately  preceding  the 
determination.  

In order to identify the quantity of the underlying commodity meeting the conditions of 

3. 
paragraph 1, competent authorities shall take into account the following criteria: 

(a)  the storage arrangements for the underlying commodity;  

(b)  the factors that may affect the supply of the underlying commodity.

Methodology for determining the baseline figure for other months’ limits 

1.  Competent  authorities  shall  determine  a  baseline  figure  for  the  other  months’  position 
limit  in  a  commodity  derivative  by  calculating  25%  of  the  open  interest  in  that  commodity 
derivative . 

2.  The baseline figure shall be specified in lots which shall be the unit of trading used by the 
trading venue on which the commodity derivative trades representing a standardised quantity 
of the underlying commodity. 

 

Article 12 

(Article 57(3) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Open interest 

Competent  authorities  shall  calculate  the  open  interest  in  a  commodity  derivative  by 
aggregating the number  of lots of that commodity  derivative that are outstanding on trading 
venues at a point in time.  

 

Article 13

Methodology for determining the baseline figure in respect of certain contracts 

1.  By  way  of  derogation  to  Article  9,  competent  authorities  shall  determine  the  baseline 
figure for the spot month position limits for cash settled spot month contracts which are under 
Section C(10) of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU and which have no measurable deliverable 
supply  of  their  underlying  commodities  by  calculating  25%  of  the  open  interest  in  those 
commodity derivative contracts. 

2.  By  way  of  derogation  to  Articles  9  and  11,  competent  authorities  shall  determine  the 
baseline  figure  for  the  position  limits  for  commodity  derivatives  defined  under  point  (c)  of 
Article  4(1)(44)  of  Directive  2014/65/EU  by  calculating  25%  of  the  number  of  securities 
issued.  

The baseline figure shall be specified in number of securities. 

3.  By way of derogation to Articles 9 and 11, where a commodity derivative provides that 
the  underlying  is  delivered  constantly  over  a  specified  period  of  time,  the  baseline  figures 
calculated pursuant to Articles 9 and 11 shall apply to related commodity derivatives for the 
same underlying to the extent that their delivery periods overlap.

2014/65/EU with a total  number of securities in issue not exceeding 10 million over a 
consecutive three months period, the competent authority shall set the limit of positions 
held in those commodity derivatives at 2.5 million securities.

(Text with EEA relevance) 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/2012, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 26(9) thereof,  

Whereas:

(3)

 

(4)

 

For  the  purposes  of  effective  data  analysis  by  competent  authorities,  there  should  be 
consistency in the standards and formats used when reporting transactions .  

Given  market  practices,  supervisory  experience  and  market  developments,  the 
meaning  of  a  transaction  for  reporting  purposes  should  be  broad  and  not  be 
exhaustively defined.  It should cover purchases and sales of reportable instruments as 
well as other cases of acquisition or disposal of reportable instruments,  as these may 
also give rise to market abuse concerns. Furthermore, changes to notional amount may 
give rise to market abuse concerns as they are similar in nature to additional purchase 
or  sale  transactions.  In  order  for  competent  authorities  to  distinguish  those  changes 
from  other  purchases  or  sales,  those  changes  should  be  specifically  reported  in 
transaction reports.  

However, the concept of a transaction should not include acts or events which do not 
need to be reported to competent authorities for market surveillance purposes. In order 
to ensure that such acts and events are filtered out of transaction reporting, they should 
be specifically excluded from the meaning of a transaction.    

For  the  purposes  of  clarifying  which  investment  firms  are  required  to  report 
transactions,  the  activities  or  services  which  lead  to  a  transaction  should  be  defined. 
Accordingly,  an  investment  firm  should  be  considered  to  be  executing  a  transaction 
where  it  performs  a  service  or  activity  referred  to  in  points  1  to  3  of  Section  A  of 
Annex I of [Directive 2014/65/EU], makes the investment decision in accordance with

a discretionary mandate given by a client, or transfers financial instruments to or from 
accounts,  provided  in  each  case  that  such  services  or  activities  have  resulted  in  a 
transaction.  However,  by  way  of  exception  in  accordance  with  Article  26(4)  of 
Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014,  investment  firms  which  are  considered  to  have 
transmitted  orders  which  result  in  transactions  should  be  considered  to  have  not 
executed those transactions.   

In order to avoid non-reporting or double reporting by investment firms who transmit 
orders  to  each  other,  they  should  agree  whether  the  firm  receiving  the  transmitted 
order will report all the details  in  its  transaction report of the resulting transaction or 
transmit the order onwards to another investment firm. In the absence of an agreement 
and to avoid non-reporting or double reporting, the transmitting firm should submit its 
own  transaction  report  which  includes  all  the  details  of  the  resulting  transaction  and 
the  receiving  firm  should  submit  a  transaction  report  which  does  not  include  the 
transmitted  details.    Moreover,  the  details  relating  to  the  order  to  be  transmitted 
between firms  should be prescribed in  order to  ensure that the relevant,  accurate and 
complete information ultimately reaches competent authorities.    

For  the  purpose  of  ensuring  certain  and  efficient  identification  of  investment  firms 
responsible  for  execution  of  transactions,  those  firms  should  ensure  that  they  are 
identified  in  the  transaction  report  submitted  pursuant  to  their  transaction  reporting 
obligation using validated, issued and duly renewed legal entity identifiers (LEIs).  

In order to ensure consistent and robust identification of natural persons referred to in 
transaction reports, they should be identified by a concatenation of the country of their 
nationality  followed  by  identifiers  assigned  by  the  country  of  nationality  of  those 
persons.  Where  those  identifiers  are  not  available,  it  is  necessary  to  identify  natural 
persons by identifiers created from a concatenation of their date of birth and name.  

In  order  to  facilitate  market  surveillance,  client  identification  should  be  consistent, 
unique and robust.  Transaction reports should therefore include the full name and date 
of  birth  of  clients  who  are  natural  persons  and  should  identify  clients  who  are  legal 
entities by their LEIs.   

Persons  or computer algorithms which make investment decisions may be responsible 
for  market  abuse.  Therefore,  in  order  to  ensure  effective  market  surveillance,  where 
investment  decisions  are  made  by  a  person  other  than  the  client  or  by  a  computer 
algorithm, the persons or algorithm should be identified in the transaction report using 
unique,  robust  and  consistent  identifiers.  Where  more  than  one  person  in  an 
investment  firm  makes  the  investment  decision,  the  person  taking  the  primary 
responsibility for the decision should be identified in the report.  

(10)

  The persons or computer algorithms responsible for  determining the venue to access, 
which firms to transmit the orders to or any other conditions related to the execution of 
the  order  can  thereby  be  responsible  for  market  abuse.  Therefore,  in  order  to  ensure 

EN 

424 

EN 

 

 

 

effective  market  surveillance,  a  person  or  computer  algorithm  within  the  investment 
firm that is responsible for the above activities should be identified in the transaction 
report.  Where  both  a  person  and  computer  algorithm  are  involved,  or  more  than  one 
person or algorithm is involved, the investment firm should determine, on a consistent 
basis,  which  person  or  algorithm  is  primarily  responsible  for  undertaking  those 
activities.   

(11)

 

In  order  to  enable  effective  market  monitoring,  transaction  reports  should  include 
exact  information  on  any  change  in  the  position  of  an  investment  firm  or  its  client 
resulting  from  a  reportable  transaction  at  the  time  such  transaction  took  place. 
Therefore  investment  firms  should  report  related  fields  in  an  individual  transaction 
report consistently and should report a transaction or different legs of a transaction in 
such  manner  that  collectively  their  reports  provide  a  clear  overall  picture  which 
accurately reflects changes in position.  

(12)

  Effective  market surveillance in the case of a transaction in a combination of financial 
instruments  presents  particular  challenges  for  market  surveillance.  The  competent 
authority  needs  to  have  the  global  view  and  also  be  able  to  see  separately  the 
transaction  in  respect  of  each  financial  instrument  that  is  part  of  a  transaction  in  a 
combination  of  financial  instruments.  Therefore,  investment  firms  which  execute 
transactions in a combination of financial instruments should report the transaction for 
each  financial  instrument  separately  and  link  those  reports  by  an  identifier  that  is 
unique  at  the  level  of  the  firm  to  the  group  of  transaction  reports  related  to  that 
execution. 

(13)

 

In order to safeguard the effectiveness of market  abuse surveillance of legal persons, 
Member  States  should  ensure  that  LEIs  are  developed,  attributed  and  maintained  in 
accordance with internationally established principles. For similar reasons, investment 
firms  should  obtain  their  clients’  LEIs  from  their  clients  before  providing  services 
which would trigger reporting obligations in respect of transactions effected on behalf 
of those clients.   

(14)

  Efficient  and  effective  market  monitoring  requires  that  transaction  reports  be 
submitted once only and to a single competent authority who can route them to other 
relevant  competent  authorities.  Therefore,  where  an  investment  firm  executes  a 
transaction,  it  should  report  the  transaction  once  only,  and  that  report  should  be 
submitted  to  its  home  competent  authority.  The  principle  of  single  reporting  should 
apply  irrespective  of  whether  the  reporting  firm  executed  the  transaction  through  a 
branch in another Member State. Moreover, where a transaction is executed wholly or 
partly  through  a  branch  of  an  investment  firm  located  in  another  Member  State,  the 
principle of reporting to the home Member State of the investment firm should apply 
unless  otherwise  agreed  by  the  competent  authorities  of  the  home  and  host  Member 
States.  In  order  to  ensure  that  host  competent  authorities  can  supervise  the  services 
provided  by  branches  within  their  territory,  they  will  need  to  receive  transaction 
reports of activity by branches of investment firms. For this reason and to allow for the 

EN 

425 

EN 

 

 

 

transaction  reports  to  be  routed  to  all  the  relevant  competent  authorities  for  the 
branches that take part in those transactions it is necessary to include granular data on 
branch activity in the reports. 

(15)

  Complete  and  accurate  transaction  reporting  data  is  essential  to  market  abuse 
surveillance. Therefore trading venues and investment firms should have methods and 
arrangements  to  ensure  complete  and  accurate  transaction  reports  are  submitted  to 
competent authorities.   

(16)

  Determination  of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity enables the routing of 
transaction reports to other competent authorities and enables investors to identify the 
competent  authorities  to  whom  they  must  report  their  short  positions  pursuant  to 
Articles 5, 7 and 8 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of 
the  Council  .  The  rules  for  determining  which  is  the  relevant  competent  authority 
under  Directive  2004/39/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council    work 
effectively  for  most  financial  instruments  and  should,  therefore,  remain  unchanged. 
However, new rules should be introduced specifically for those instruments which are 
not  covered  by  Directive  2004/39/EC,  namely  for  debt  instruments  issued  by  a  non-
EEA  entity  and  for  derivatives  for  which  the  immediate  underlying  has  no  global 
identifier, is a basket or a non-EEA index.

nationality,  the  highest  priority  identifier  in  accordance  with  the  field  referring  to  ‘all  other 
countries’ provided in  Annex  II shall apply. Where a natural  person has  EEA and non-EEA 
nationality,  the  highest  priority  identifier  related  to  the  EEA  nationality  as  determined  in 
accordance with paragraph 2 shall be used. 

4.  Where the applicable identifier specified in  Annex II as determined in accordance with 
paragraph 2 refers to CONCAT, the natural person shall be identified by the investment firm 
using an identifier created from the concatenation of the following elements in the following 
order: 

(a)  the date of birth of the person in the format YYYYMMDD; 

(b)  the five first characters of the first name; 

(c)  the five first characters of the surname. 

5.  For the purposes of paragraph 4, prefixes to names shall be excluded and first names and 
surnames shorter than five characters shall be appended by '#' so as to ensure that references 
to names and surnames in accordance with paragraph 4 contain five characters. All characters 
shall be in  upper case.  No apostrophes, accents,  hyphens, punctuation  marks or spaces shall 
be used.

1.  Where a person or computer algorithm within an investment firm makes the decision to 
acquire  or  dispose  of  a  specific  financial  instrument  (‘investment  decision’),  that  person  or 
computer algorithm shall be identified in field 57 of Annex I. The investment firm shall only 
identify such a person or computer algorithm where the acquisition or disposal is made either

on  behalf  of  the  investment  firm  itself,  or  on  behalf  of  a  client  in  accordance  with  a 
discretionary mandate given to it by the client.  

2.  Where more than one person within the investment firm makes the investment decision, 
the  investment  firm  shall  determine  who  is  the  person  taking  the  primary  responsibility  for 
that decision. The determination of the person taking primary responsibility for the investment 
decision shall be made on a consistent basis 

3.  Where a computer algorithm within the investment firm is responsible for the investment 
decision  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1,  the  investment  firm  shall  assign  a  designation  for 
identifying the computer algorithm in a transaction report. That designation shall comply with

of XXX 

 

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the 
maintenance of relevant data relating to orders in financial instruments 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/20121 , and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 25(3) thereof,  

Whereas:  

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

Operators  of  trading  venues  should  be  free  to  determine  the  manner  in  which  they 
maintain  records  of  relevant  data  relating  to  all  orders  in  financial  instruments. 
However, in order to enable effective and efficient collation, comparison and analysis 
of the relevant order data for market monitoring purposes, such information needs to 
be available to the competent authorities in uniform standards and formats. Therefore, 
upon a request by a competent authority pursuant to Article 25(2) of Regulation (EU) 
No  600/2014,  the  relevant  order  data  should  be  converted  into  the  standards  and 
formats specified in this Regulation.  

The Annex to  this Regulation contains all data elements relating to  orders, including 
those  already  included  in  the  scope  of  Article  25(2)  of  Regulation  No  600/2014  by 
reference to Article 26(1) and (3) in order to ensure clarity, legal certainty and avoid 
double storage of the same information.  

In  order  to  detect  and  investigate  potential  or  attempted  market  abuse  effectively, 
competent  authorities  need  to  promptly  identify  persons  and  entities  who  may  be 
significantly  involved  in  the  order  process,  including  members  or  participants  of 
trading  venues,  entities  responsible  for  investment  and  execution  decisions,  non-
executing  brokers  and  clients  on  whose  behalf  orders  are  initiated.  Accordingly 
operators of trading venues should maintain designations for such parties.

In order to allow competent authorities to more efficiently identify suspicious patterns 
of potentially abusive behaviour originating from one client, including where the client 
is  operating  through  a  number  of  investment  firms,  the  operators  of  trading  venues 
should  record  the  identity  of  clients  on  whose  behalf  their  members  or  participants 
submitted  the  order.  Operators  should  identify  those  clients  by  unique  identifiers  in 
order  to  facilitate  certain  and  efficient  identification  of  such  persons  and  thereby 
facilitate  more  effective  analysis  of  potential  market  abuse  in  which  clients  may  be 
involved. 

Operators of trading venues should not  be required to  record client  identifiers for  all 
clients  in  the  trading  chain  but  only  for  the  client  on  whose  behalf  the  member  or 
participant submitted the order.   

The  identification  of  market  making  strategies  or  similar  activities  is  important  in 
order to enable efficient detection of market manipulation. This allows the competent 
authorities to distinguish the order flow coming from an investment firm acting on the 
basis of terms  pre-determined by the issuer of the instrument  which is the subject  of 
the order or by the trading venue to which the order is submitted  from the order flow 
coming from an investment firm acting at its own or at its client’s discretion.  

The  record  of  the  precise  date  and  time  and  of  the  details  of  any  order  placement, 
modification, cancellation, rejection and execution should be maintained. This allows 
monitoring the changes to the order throughout its lifetime, that can be significant in 
detecting and assessing potential market manipulation and front running behaviours.  

To  ensure  an  accurate  and  complete  picture  of  the  order  book  of  a  trading  venue, 
competent  authorities  require  information  on  trading  sessions  in  which  financial 
instruments  are  traded.  This  information  can  notably  be  used  to  determine  when 
auction  periods  or  continuous  trading  start  and  finish  and  whether  orders  cause 
unscheduled circuit breakers. This information is also required to identify how orders 
will  interact,  particularly  when  sessions  end  at  random  periods  such  as  auctions. 
Information  on  indicative  uncrossing  prices  and  volumes  would  also  assist  in 
analysing  possible  auction  manipulation.  Given  that  a  single  order  can  impact  either 
the auction uncrossing price, auction uncrossing volume or both, competent authorities 
need  to  see  the  impact  of  each  order  on  these  values  as.  Without  this  information  it 
would  be  difficult  to  identify  which  order  has  had  the  impact  on  those  values. 
Additionally, a sequence number should be assigned to each relevant event in order to 
determine  the  sequence  of  events  when  two  or  more  events  take  place  at  the  same 
time.  

(9)

 

Specification  of  the  position  of  the  orders  in  an  order  book  allows  for  the 
reconstruction  of  the  order  book  and  for  analysis  of  the  sequence  of  execution  of 
orders  which  is  an  important  element  of  market  abuse  surveillance.  The  position 
assigned  to  an  order  depends  on  how  priority  is  determined  by  the  trading  system. 
Therefore,  operators  of  trading  venues  should  assign  and  maintain  details  of  the 

EN 

481 

EN 

 

 

 

priority of orders according to the price visibility-time priority or the size-time priority 
method. 

(10)

 

In order to enable effective market monitoring it is necessary to be able to link orders 
with their corresponding transactions. Accordingly operators of trading venues should 
maintain distinctive transaction identification codes linking orders to transactions.  

(11)

  Operators of trading venues should, for each order received,  record and  maintain the 
order  type  and  the  related  specific  instructions  which  together  determine  how  each 
order  is  to  be  handled  by  their  matching  engines,  in  accordance  with  their  own 
classifications.  This  detailed  information  is  essential  for  competent  authorities  to  be 
able  to  monitor,  as  part  of  its  market  abuse  surveillance,  trading  activity  in  a  given 
trading venue order book and in particular to replicate how each order behaves within 
the  order  book.  However,  given  the  broad  range  of  existing  and  potential  new  order 
types designed by operators of trading venues and the specific technicalities attached 
to  the latter, the maintenance of this detailed information  according to  the operators’ 
internal  classification  system  may  not  currently  allow  competent  authorities  to 
replicate  the  order  book  activity  of  all  trading  venues  in  a  consistent  manner. 
Therefore,  for  competent  authorities  to  be  in  a  position  to  exactly  locate  each  order 
within  the  order  book,  operators  of  trading  venues  should  also  classify  each  order 
received either as a limit order where the order is tradable or as a stop order where the 
order becomes tradable only upon the realisation of a pre-determined price event.

May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and

Clock synchronisation has a direct impact in many areas. In particular it contributes to 
ensuring that post-trade transparency data can readily be part of a reliable consolidated 
tape. It is also essential for conducting cross-venue monitoring of orders and detecting 
instances of market abuse and allows for a clearer comparison between the transaction 
and the market conditions prevailing at the time of their execution.  

The  number  of  orders  received  every  second  by  a  trading  venue  can  be  very  high, 
much higher than that of executed transactions. This may extend to several thousands 
of  orders  per  second  depending  on  the  trading  venue,  the  type  of  members  or 
participants  or  clients  of  a  given  trading  venue,  and  the  financial  instruments’ 
volatility  and  liquidity.  As  a  result,  a  time  granularity  of  one  second  would  not  be 
sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  effective  market  manipulation  surveillance  of  certain 
types of trading activities. Therefore, it is necessary to establish minimum granularity 
requirements  for  recording  the  date  and  time  of  reportable  events  by  operators  of 
trading venues and their members or participants.  

Competent  authorities  need  to  be  able  to  reconstruct  all  events  relating  to  an  order 
throughout  the  lifetime  of  each  order  in  an  accurate  time  sequence.  Competent 
authorities need to be able to reconstruct these events over multiple trading venues on 
a consolidated level to be able to conduct effective cross-venue monitoring on market 
abuse.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  establish  a  common  reference  time  and  rules  on

maximum divergence from the common reference time to ensure that all operators of 
trading venues and their members or participants are recording the date and time based 
on  the  same  time  source  and  in  accordance  with  consistent  standards.  It  is  also 
necessary  to  provide  for  accurate  time  stamping  to  allow  competent  authorities  to 
distinguish  between  different  reportable  events  which  may  otherwise  appear  to  have 
taken place at the same time.  

There are however, trading models for which increased accuracy might not be relevant 
or  feasible.  Voice  trading  systems  or  request  for  quote  systems  where  the  response 
requires human intervention or does not  allow algorithmic trading, or systems which 
are used for concluding negotiated transactions should be subject to different accuracy 
standards. Trading venues operating those trading systems are not typically susceptible 
to the high volume of events that can happen within the same second, meaning that it 
is not necessary to impose a finer granularity to time stamping of those events since it 
is  less  likely  that  there  would  be  multiple  events  occurring  at  the  same  time.  In 
addition, trades on those trading venues may be agreed using manual methods which 
can take time to agree. In those trading venues there is also an inherent delay between 
the moment when the trade is executed and the moment when the trade is recorded in 
the  trading  system,  meaning  that  applying  more  stringent  accuracy  requirements 
would  not  necessarily  lead  to  more  meaningful  and  accurate  record  keeping  by  the 
operator of the trading venue, its members or participants. 

Competent  authorities  need  to  understand  how  trading  venues  and  their  members  or 
participants are ensuring their traceability to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This 
is  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  different  systems  and  the  number  of  alternative 
methods that can be used to synchronise to UTC. Given that clock drift can be affected 
by many different elements, it is also appropriate to determine an acceptance level for 
the maximum divergence from UTC. 

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group

Article 1 

Reference time  

Operators of trading venues and their members or participants shall synchronise the business 
clocks  they  use  to  record  the  date  and  time  of  any  reportable  event  with  the  Coordinated 
Universal Time (UTC) issued and maintained by the timing centres listed in the latest Bureau 
International  des  Poids  et  Mesures  Annual  Report  on  Time  Activities.  Operators  of  trading 
venues and their members or participants may also synchronise the business clocks they use 
to  record  the  date  and  time  of  any  reportable  event  with  UTC  disseminated  by  a  satellite 
system, provided that any offset from UTC is accounted for and removed from the timestamp. 

 

Article 2 

Level of accuracy for operators of trading venues 

1.  Operators of trading venues shall ensure that their business clocks adhere to the levels of 
accuracy  specified  in  Table  1  of  the  Annex  according  to  the  gateway  to  gateway  latency  of 
each of their trading systems.  

Gateway  to  gateway  latency  shall  be  the  time  measured  from  the  moment  a  message  is 
received by an outer gateway of the trading venue’s system, sent through the order submission 
protocol, processed by the matching engine, and then sent back until an acknowledgement is 
sent from the gateway. 

2.  By derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, operators of trading venues that operate a 
voice  trading  system,  request  for  quote  system  where  the  response  requires  human 
intervention  or  does  not  allow  algorithmic  trading,  or  a  system  that  formalises  negotiated 
transactions in accordance with Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 shall ensure 
that  their  business  clocks  do  not  diverge  by  more  than  one  second  from  UTC  referred  to  in 
Article 1(1) of this Regulation. The operator of the trading venue shall ensure that times are 
recorded to at least a one second granularity. 

3.  Operators  of  trading  venues  that  operate  multiple  types  of  trading  systems  shall  ensure 
that each system adheres to the level of accuracy applicable to that system in accordance with 
paragraphs 1 and 2.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,  

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council  of  15  May  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Regulation  (EU)  No 
648/2012, and in particular Article 29(3) thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

In  order  to  manage  operational  and  other  risks,  when  transactions  in  cleared 
derivatives  are  submitted  and  accepted  for  clearing  and  to  provide  certainty  to 
counterparties  as  soon  as  possible,  it  is  important  to  determine  whether  a  cleared 
derivative  transaction  can  be  cleared  by  a  CCP  at  an  early  stage,  and  to  the  extent 
possible before the transaction is entered into.  

In  order  to  apply  scalable  technical  solutions  ensuring  that  transactions  in  cleared 
derivatives  can  be  submitted  and  accepted  for  clearing  as  quickly  as  technologically 
practicable,  the  information  needed  by  a  trading  venue  and  a  CCP  to  perform  their 
tasks  should  be  pre-determined  and  clearly  set  in  the  documentation  of  the  trading 
venue and the CCP. 

In order to appropriately price a cleared derivative transaction, counterparties take into 
account  that  centrally  cleared  transactions  are  subject  to  a  different  collateral  regime 
than non-centrally cleared transactions, regardless of whether the transaction is cleared 
because it is mandated to be cleared or whether the transaction is cleared because the 
relevant  parties  have  otherwise  agreed  for  it  to  be  cleared.  Therefore,  counterparties 
should  benefit  from  having  the  same  process  and  the  same  requirements  for  both 
mandatorily  cleared  and  voluntarily  cleared  derivative  transactions  to  ensure  cleared 
derivative  transactions  are  submitted  and  accepted  for  clearing  as  soon  as 
technologically practicable.

  When  cleared  derivative  transactions  are  entered  into  on  a  trading  venue,  in  order  to 
identify before a transaction is entered into whether the transaction can be cleared by a 
CCP, the trading venue and the CCP should have rules to ensure a transaction that is 
entered into can be automatically cleared, otherwise the trading venue should provide 
the  ability  to  clearing  members  of  the  CCP  to  check  orders  against  the  limits  set  for 
their  clients.  When  a  trading  venue  or  a  clearing  member  are  using  the  services  of  a 
service  provider  to  perform  part  or  all  of  the  pre-trade  checks  applicable  in  this 
Regulation,  the  trading  venue  and  the  clearing  member  remain  responsible  for 
complying with the requirements applicable to each of them.

The time granted to a trading venue to process a cleared derivative transaction should 
be  shorter  for  electronically  traded  cleared  derivative  transactions  than  for  non-
electronically  traded  cleared  derivative  transactions  as  the  level  of  automated 
processing should be higher in the former case.  

A trading venue should send the information related to cleared derivative transactions 
to  a  CCP  in  a  pre-agreed  electronic  format,  for  both  electronically  traded  and  non-
electronically  traded  cleared  derivative  transactions.  Therefore,  the  time  granted  to  a 
CCP  to  decide  whether  a  cleared  derivative  transaction  can  be  accepted  for  clearing 
should  be  the  same  for  electronically  traded  and  non-electronically  traded  cleared 
derivative transactions. 

The  processing  of  cleared  derivative  transactions  entered  into  on  a  bilateral  basis  is 
usually  less  automated  than  the  processing  of  cleared  derivative  transactions  entered 
into  on  a  trading  venue.  Therefore,  the  time  granted  to  counterparties  to  submit  a 
cleared  derivative  transaction  entered  into  on  a  bilateral  basis  to  a  CCP  should  be 
longer than the time granted for a cleared derivative transaction executed on a trading 
venue.  

In  order  to  manage  the  credit  risks  related  to  cleared  derivative  transactions  that  are 
entered into on a bilateral basis, a CCP should allow a clearing member to review the 
transaction  details  of  its  client  and  to  decide  whether  to  accept  it.  As  the  process 
between  a  CCP  and  a  clearing  member  is  usually  automated,  this  process  should 
require limited time.  

CCPs  as  well  as  clearing  members  manage  credit  risk  associated  to  the  build-up  of 
current  exposures  resulting  from  the  clearing  of  cleared  derivatives.  Typically,  this 
includes the setting of limits  by the CCP or the clearing member per counterparty in 
order  to  mitigate  the  associated  exposure  risk,  which  can  result  in  new  requests  to 
clear certain cleared derivative transactions not being accepted by the clearing member 
or by the CCP. Ensuring that cleared derivative transactions are submitted to clearing 
as quickly as technologically practicable does not eliminate the risk that some of these 
cleared  derivative  transactions  could  not  be  accepted  for  clearing  under  specific 
circumstances.  Therefore,  when  cleared  derivative  transactions  are  not  accepted  for 

EN 

 

510 

  EN 

 

 

 

clearing,  counterparties  should  have  clarity  on  the  treatment  of  the  not  accepted 
transaction in order to take the status of the not accepted transaction into account when 
hedging their risk and continuing on with their usual activity. 

(10)

  As  the  processing  of  a  cleared  derivative  transaction  executed  electronically  on  a 
trading venue and submitted for clearing to a CCP requires limited time, the time for 
the market to move and for the value and the risk of the cleared derivative transaction 
to  change  in  between  the  order  and  the  non-acceptance  would  also  be  very  limited, 
therefore  there  should  be  no  or  extremely  limited  damage  suffered  by  the 
counterparties whose transactions are not accepted by the CCP. To provide certainty to 
counterparties,  cleared  derivative  transactions  executed  electronically  on  a  trading 
venue and not accepted by a CCP should be considered void.  

(11)

  As  the  processing  of  cleared  derivative  transactions  other  than  cleared  derivative 
transactions  executed  electronically  on  a  trading  venue  usually  takes  some  time,  this 
period of time may be sufficiently long for the market to have moved and for the value 
and the risk of the cleared derivative transaction to  have changed significantly in  the 
meantime,  therefore  the  voiding  of  the  transaction  could  not  be  applied  as  the 
appropriate treatment for all non-acceptances. To provide certainty on the treatment of 
such  transactions  not  accepted  by  a  CCP,  the  counterparties  should  still  know  in 
advance how the transaction is to be treated, relying on the rules of the trading venue 
or on the contractual arrangements between the counterparties where appropriate. 

(12)

  When  a  cleared  derivative  transaction  is  not  accepted  for  clearing  for  reasons  other 
than credit reasons, the counterparties may still want to be counterparties to a cleared 
derivative  transaction  with  the  same  economic  terms  and  that  could  be  accepted  for 
clearing  if  not  for  these  non-credit  reasons.  When  both  counterparties  agree  to  re-
submit the transaction, as long as it is within a relatively short period of time from the 
first  submission,  and  that  it  allows  the  investigation  and  the  resolution  of  the  non-
credit reasons why the transaction was not accepted, a second submission in the form 
of  a  new  cleared  derivative  transaction  with  the  same  economic  terms  would  still 
ensure proper management of operational or other risks.  

(13)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No

except where all the conditions set out in points (a), (b) and (c)  are satisfied:  

(a)  the  rules  of  the  trading  venue  require  that  each  member  or  participant  of  the  trading 
venue, which is not  a clearing member of a CCP through which the cleared derivative 
transaction is cleared, has a contractual arrangement with a clearing member of the CCP 
under  which  the  clearing  member  automatically  becomes  counterparty  to  the  cleared 
derivative transaction;

basis.  

5.  The  clearing  member  and  the  trading  venue  shall  inform  the  counterparty  that  executed

Article 4 

Timeframes for the transfer of information for cleared derivative transactions executed 

on a bilateral basis 

1.  For  cleared  derivative  transactions  executed  by  counterparties  on  a  bilateral  basis,  the 
clearing member shall:  

(a)  obtain evidence from its client of the execution timeframe of the transaction they clear;  

(b)  ensure that the counterparties send to the CCP the information referred to in Article 1(2) 

related to the transaction within 30 minutes from the execution of the transaction.

seconds from receiving the information from the CCP. 

3.  The  CCP  shall  accept  or  not  accept  the  clearing  of  a  cleared  derivative  transaction 
executed  on  a  bilateral  basis  within  10  seconds  from  the  receipt  of  the  clearing  member’s 
acceptance or non-acceptance. 

4.  However,  paragraphs  2  and  3  of  this  Article  shall  not  apply  where  all  the  following 
conditions are met: 

(a)  the rules of the CCP ensure the setting and the maintenance on a regular basis of limits 
by a clearing member for its client pursuant to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
xxx (MiFIR RTS 6 Regulation number OJ L […], […], p. […]);  

EN

  EN 

 

 

 

(b)  the rules of the CCP provide that a cleared derivative transaction that is within the limits 
in  accordance  with  point  (a)  is  cleared  automatically  by  the  CCP  within  60  seconds 
from  receiving  the  information  on  the  cleared  derivative  transaction  from  the 
counterparties. 

5.  The CCP that does not accept the clearing of a cleared derivative transaction executed on 
a bilateral basis shall inform the clearing member of the non-acceptance on a real time basis. 
The  clearing  member  shall  inform  of  the  non-acceptance  the  counterparty  that  executed  the 
transaction as soon as it is informed by the CCP.

is not accepted by the CCP, the trading venue shall void such contract.  

2.  Where a cleared derivative transaction, other than cleared derivative transactions that are 
executed on a trading venue electronically, is  not  accepted by the CCP, the treatment  of the 
transaction shall be governed by: 

(a)  the rules of the trading venue when the contract is submitted to clearing in accordance 

with the rules of the trading venue; 

(b)  the agreement between the counterparties in the other situations.  

3.  Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, when the non-acceptance is due 
to  a  technical  or  clerical  problem,  the  cleared  derivative  transaction  can  be  submitted  for 
clearing  once  more  within  one  hour  from  the  previous  submission  in  the  form  of  a  new 
transaction but with the same economic terms, provided that both counterparties have agreed 
to this second submission. The trading venue, on which the cleared derivative transaction was 
initially executed shall not be subject to the requirements of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 
600/2014 for the submission to clearing of the new cleared derivative transaction.

of [date] 

supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 

Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the data to be 
provided by execution venues on the quality of execution of transactions 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,  

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1 and in  particular point (a)  of the first  subparagraph of Article 27(10) 
thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

  With a view to provide the public, and including investment firms, with relevant data 
on execution quality to help them determine the best way to execute client orders, it is 
important to set out the specific content, the format and the periodicity of data relating 
to  the  quality  of  execution  to  be  published  on  financial  instruments  subject  to  the 
trading obligation in Articles 23 and 28 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council(2) by trading venues and systematic internalisers and for 
other financial instruments by execution venues. In this respect, due regard should be 
given to the type of execution venue and the type of financial instrument concerned.  

(2)

 

In order to fully assess the extent of the quality of execution of transactions that take 
place  in  the  European  Union,  it  is  appropriate  that  execution  venues  which  can  be 
selected  by  investment  firms  for  the  execution  of  the  orders  of  their  clients  are 
required to  comply  with  requirements on data to be provided by  execution venues in 
accordance with this Regulation. To this effect, these execution venues should include 
regulated  markets,  multilateral  trading  facilities,  systematic  internalisers,  market 
makers  or  other  liquidity  providers,  which  are  identified  as  execution  venues  in 
accordance  with  Article  44  of  Commission  Directive  2006/73/EC.  Organised  trading 

                                                 

1 OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349. 
2 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in 
financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 84).

518 

  EN

(5)

 

facilities should also  be  included in  order to  take account of the recognition  of these 
venues as trading venues in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EC. 

Differences  in  the  type  of  execution  venue  and  financial  instruments  require  that  the 
content  of  reporting  should  vary  depending  on  several  factors.  It  is  appropriate  to 
differentiate  the  amount  and  nature  of  reported  data  according  to  trading  systems, 
trading  modes  and  trading  platforms  to  provide  a  proper  context  for  the  quality  of 
execution obtained. 

To  avoid  inappropriate  comparison  between  execution  venues  and  ensure  the 
relevance  of  collected  data,  execution  venues  should  submit  separate  reports 
corresponding  to  segments  that  operate  different  order  books  or  that  are  regulated 
differently or use different market segment identifiers. 

In  order  to  provide  an  accurate  picture  of  the  quality  of  execution  that  effectively 
occurred, trading venues should not publish among executed trades those traded over 
the counter and reported onto the trading venue.   

(6)

  When reporting as execution venues for financial instruments not subject to the trading 
obligations,  market  makers  and  other  liquidity  providers  should  only  publish 
information on the orders executed or any price quoted for their clients, when offered 
or  executed  over  the  counter,  or  executed  pursuant  to  Article  4  and  9  of  Regulation 
(EU)  No  600/2014  except  orders  held  in  an  order  management  facility  of  a  trading 
venue pending disclosure.   

(7)

 

(8)

 

(9)

 

It  is  appropriate  to  consider  that  other  liquidity  providers  should  include  firms  that 
hold  themselves  out  as  being  willing  to  deal  on  own  account,  and  which  provide 
liquidity  as  part  of  their  normal  business  activity,  whether  or  not  they  have  formal 
agreements in place or commit to providing liquidity on a continuous basis. 

In  order  to  have  clear  transparency  on  the  quality  of  execution  for  transactions  in 
relation to price, it is appropriate to require that when publishing information on price, 
the price should exclude all commissions or accrued interest when relevant. 

In determining appropriate information for assessing price quality, both daily average 
levels and point-in-time information should be required. This will provide participants 
with an appropriate context and a more complete picture when analysing the quality of 
execution  obtained.  In  order  to  allow  for  price  comparisons  between  financial 
instruments  it  is  also  necessary  to  specify  the  currency  code  of  any  reported 
transaction.  

(10)

  To  ensure  regulatory  consistency,  it  is  not  appropriate  to  require  trading  venues  to 
provide  details  of  transactions  that  are  still,  at  the  time  of  publication,  subject  to  a 
deferral of publication in compliance with requirements on post trade transparency. It 

EN 

 

519 

  EN 

 

 

 

(11)

 

is  also  appropriate  that  systematic  internalisers,  market  makers  and  other  liquidity 
providers  be  exempt  from  publishing  point-in-time  transaction  data  for  any 
transactions above standard market size or size specific to the financial instrument in 
order  to  avoid  those  venues  becoming  subject  to  undue  risk  of  disclosing 
commercially sensitive information that might hinder their ability to hedge exposures 
and provide liquidity. For shares, exchanges traded funds and certificates deemed to be 
illiquid under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the standard market size threshold to be 
used  will  be  the  minimum  available  standard  market  size  for  that  type  of  financial 
instrument. To avoid uncertainty, it is appropriate to clarify that reference to large in 
scale and size specific to the financial instrument follow the same meaning as set out 
in the post trade transparency requirements.  

It  is  essential  for  the  public  to  have  full  transparency  on  all  costs  charged  when 
executing  an  order  through  a  given  venue.  In  determining  the  total  costs  relevant  to 
execution  it  is  necessary  to  specify  all  the  relevant  costs  in  the  execution  of  a  client 
order  related  to  the  use  of  a  specific  venue  and  for  which  the  client  pays  directly  or 
indirectly.  Those  costs  should  include  execution  fees,  including  fees  for  the 
submission,  modification  or  cancellation  of  orders  or  quotes  withdrawals,  as  well  as 
any fees related to market data access or use of terminals. The relevant costs may also 
include  clearing  or  settlement  fees  or  any  other  fees  paid  to  third  parties  involved  in 
the execution of the order when they are part of the services provided by the execution 
venue. Information on costs should also include taxes or levies directly invoiced to, or 
incurred by the venue on behalf of the members or users of the execution venue or the 
client to whom the order refers.   

(12)

  Likelihood  of  execution  indicates  the  probability  of  execution  of  a  particular  type  of 
order and is supported by details on trading volumes in a particular instrument or other 
characteristics  of  orders  and  transactions.  Information  on  likelihood  of  execution 
should allow for the calculation of metrics such as the relative market size of a venue 
in  a  particular  financial  instrument  or  a  class  of  financial  instruments.  Likelihood  of 
execution  should  also  be  assessed  with  data  on  failed  transactions  or  cancelled  or 
modified  orders.  These  metrics  should  allow  participants  to  assess  the  likelihood  of 
execution of a specific financial instrument on a specific venue. 

(13)

  Speed of execution may have different  meanings for the different  types of execution 
venues  as  the  measurement  of  speed  varies  by  both  trading  systems  and  trading 
platform. For continuous auction order books, speed of execution should be expressed 
in mili-seconds while for other trading systems it is appropriate to use larger units of 
time.  It  is  also  appropriate  to  exclude  the  latency  of  a  particular  participant's 
connection  to  the  execution  venue,  as  this  is  outside  of  the  control  of  the  execution 
venue itself. 

(14)

 

In  order  to  compare  the  quality  of  execution  for  orders  of  different  size,  execution 
venues  should  be  required  to  report  on  transactions  within  several  size  ranges.  The 

EN 

 

520 

  EN 

 

 

 

thresholds for these ranges must be dependent on the type of financial instrument and 
its liquidity to ensure that they provide an adequate sample of executions in a size that 
is typical in that instrument.  

(15)

 

It is important that execution venues collect data throughout the normal hours of their 
operation. Reporting should  therefore be made without  charge in  a machine readable 
electronic format via an internet website to enable the public to download, search, sort 
and analyse all the provided data. 

(16)

  The  reports  by  execution  venues  should  be  complemented  by  the  output  of  a 
consolidated tape provider established by Directive 2014/65/EU thus allowing for the 
development of enhanced measures of execution quality. 

(17)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date. 

(18)

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

(19)

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) …/.. 

of [date] 

supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 

Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the annual 

publication by investment firms of information on the identity of execution 

venues and on the quality of execution 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,  

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on 
markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2004/92/EC  and  Directive 
2011/61/EU1 , and in particular point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 27(10) 

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

It  is  essential  to  enable  the  public  and  investors  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  an 
investment firm’s execution practices and the identity of the top five execution venues 
in terms of trading volumes where those investment firms executed client orders in the 
preceding  year.  In  order  to  make  meaningful  comparisons  and  analyse  the  choice  of 
top five execution venues it is necessary that information be published by investment 
firms specifically in respect of each class of financial instruments. In order to be able 
to fully evaluate the order flow of client orders to execution venues, investors and the 
public  should  be  able  to  clearly  identify  where  the  investment  firm  itself  was  one  of 
the top five execution venues for each  class of financial instrument. 

In  order  to  fully  assess  the  extent  of  the  quality  of  execution  being  obtained  on 
execution  venues  used  by  investment  firms  to  execute  client  orders,  including 
execution  venues  in  third  countries,  it  is  appropriate  to  require  investment  firms  to 
publish  information  required  under  this  Regulation  in  relation  to  trading  venues, 
market  makers  or  other  liquidity  providers  or  any  entity  that  performs  a  similar 
function in a third country to the functions performed by any of the foregoing. 

(3)

 

In order to provide very precise and comparable information, it is necessary to set out 
classes of financial instruments  based on their characteristics relevant  for publication

purposes.  A  class  of  financial  instruments  should  be  narrow  enough  to  reveal 
differences  in  order  execution  behaviour  between  classes  but  at  the  same  time  broad 
enough  to  ensure  that  the  reporting  obligation  on  investment  firms  is  proportionate. 
Given  the  breadth  of  the  equity  class  of  financial  instruments,  it  is  appropriate  to 
divide this class into subclasses based on liquidity. As liquidity is  an essential  factor 
governing execution behaviours and as execution venues are often competing to attract 
flows of the most frequently traded stocks, it is appropriate that equity instruments are 
classified  according  to  their  liquidity  as  determined  under  the  tick  size  regime  as  set 
out under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. 

(4)

  When publishing the identity of the top five execution venues on which they execute 
client  orders  it  is  appropriate  for  investment  firms  to  publish  information  about  the 
volume and number of orders executed on each execution venue, so that investors may 
be able to  form  an opinion as to  the flow of client  orders from  the firm  to  execution 
venue. Where, for one or several classes of financial instruments, an investment firm 
only  executes  a  very  small  number  of  orders,  information  on  the  top  five  execution 
venues  would  not  be  very  meaningful  nor  representative  of  order  execution 
arrangements. It is therefore appropriate to require investment firms to clearly indicate 
the  classes  of  financial  instruments  for  which  they  execute  a  very  small  number  of 
orders. 

(5)

 

(6)

 

(7)

 

(8)

 

To  prevent  potentially  market  sensitive  disclosures  on  the  volume  of  business  being 
conducted  by  the  investment  firm,  the  volume  of  execution  and  the  number  of 
executed  orders  should  be  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  investment  firm’s  total 
execution volumes and number of executed orders in that class of financial instrument, 
respectively, rather than as absolute values.  

It is appropriate to require investment firms to publish information which is relevant to 
their  order  execution  behaviour.  To  ensure  that  investment  firms  are  not  held 
accountable  for  order  execution  decisions  for  which  they  are  not  responsible,  it  is 
appropriate for them to disclose the percentage of orders executed on each of the top 
five  execution  venues  where  the  choice  of  execution  venue  has  been  specified  by 
clients.  

There  are  several  factors  which  may  potentially  influence  the  order  execution 
behaviour  of  investment  firms  such  as  close  links  between  investment  firms  and 
execution  venues.  Given  the  potential  materiality  of  these  factors  it  is  appropriate  to 
require  analysis  of  such  factors  in  assessing  the  quality  of  execution  obtained  on  all 
execution venues. 

The  different  order  types  can  be  an  important  factor  explaining  how  and  why 
investment  firms  are  executing  their  orders  on  a  given  execution  venue.  It  also  may 
impact  the  way  an  investment  firm  will  set  its  execution  strategies  including 
programming  of  smart  order  routers  to  meet  those  orders’  specific  purposes.  It  is 

EN 

 

540 

  EN 

 

 

 

(9)

 

(10)

therefore appropriate that a distinction between those categories be clearly marked in 
the report.  

In order to properly analyse information it is important that users are in a position to 
differentiate between the execution venues used for professional client orders and for 
retail client orders, given the notable differences in how firms obtain the best possible 
result  for  retail  clients  as  compared  to  professional  clients,  namely  that  investment 
firms  must predominantly  assess the factors  of price  and  cost  when executing orders 
from retail clients. It is therefore appropriate that information on the top five execution 
venues  be  provided  distinctly  for  retail  clients  and  professional  clients  so  that  that  a 
qualitative assessment can be made of the order flow to such venues.  

  Securities  financing  transactions  include  a  variety  of  secured  transactions  such  as 
lending  or  borrowing  securities,  repurchase  or  reverse  repurchase  transactions  and 
buy-sell  back  or  sell-buy  back  transactions.  Securities  lending  is  primarily  driven  by 
demand  for  specific  securities  and  is  used,  for  instance,  in  transactions  where 
securities are used to borrow or to lend cash or settlement purposes. SFTs are therefore 
used as a source of funding, for liquidity, and collateral management. The rationale for 
those transactions is therefore specific: in such transactions, securities are not bought 
or sold for their expected price movements but sought after or provided as collateral, 
making  their  economic  justification  very  different  from  other  types  of  transactions. 
Due  to  the  specific  nature  of  securities  financing  transactions,  and  given  that  their 
large  size  would  likely  distort  the  more  representative  set  of  client  transactions  (i.e. 
those  not  involving  securities  financing  transactions),  it  is  necessary  to  maintain 
separate  evidence  of  such  executions.  To  this  effect,  investment  firms  executing 
securities financing transactions should not include them in the same table concerning 
the top five execution venues on which they execute other client orders. It is therefore 
appropriate  that  investment  firms  summarise  and  make  public  the  top  five  execution 
venues  in  terms  of  trading  volumes  where  they  executed  securities  financing 
transactions  in  a  separate  report  so  that  that  a  qualitative  assessment  can  be  made  of 
the order flow to such venues. 

(11)

 

It  is  appropriate  that  investment  firms  should  publish  an  assessment  of  quality  of 
execution  obtained  on  all  venues  used  by  the  firm.  This  information  will  provide  a 
clear  picture  of  the  execution  strategies  and  tools  used  to  assess  the  quality  of 
execution  obtained  on  those  venues.  This  information  will  also  allow  investors  to 
assess the effectiveness of the monitoring carried out by investment firms in relation to 
those execution venues.    

(12)

 

In specifically  assessing  the quality of  execution obtained on all execution venues in 
relation to cost, it is appropriate that investment firms also perform an analysis of the 
arrangements it has with these venues in relation to payments made or received and to 
discounts, rebates or non-monetary benefits received. Such an assessment should also

allow  the  public  to  consider  how  such  arrangements  impact  the  costs  faced  by  the 
investor and how they comply with Article 27(2) of Directive 2004/65/EC.  

It  is  also  appropriate  to  determine  the  scope  of  such  publication  and  its  essential 
features, including the use that investment firms make of the data on execution quality 
available from execution venues under Regulation **(RTS under 27(10)(a)). 

Information on identity of execution venues and on the quality of execution should be 
published annually  and refer to  order execution behaviour  for  each class  of financial 
instruments in order to capture relevant changes within the preceding calendar year.  

Investment  firms  should  not  be  prevented  from  adopting  an  additional  level  of 
reporting which is more granular, provided that in such case the additional report does 
not replace but complements what is required in this Regulation.
