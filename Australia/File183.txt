ASIC closely monitors all trading activity on the securities markets run by our licensed market operators. Consistent with that, we will examine the cause and any effects of yesterday as a priority and as part of our close oversight of market operators. We note that Chi-X did provide a trading venue for ASX shares from 11:30am yesterday.Â  We are concerned any time there is an incident like this on any of our securities markets, as of course are the users of those markets. They have a legitimate expectation that Australia's securities markets perform to the highest standards. Historically, Australian trading platforms like ASX have at least met global benchmarks for up-times and reliability, with up-times on an annual basis regularly around 100%. We expect Australian market operators to continue to target this level of performance.
