Collaroy director, Mark Frederic Byers, has been banned by ASIC from managing companies for the maximum of five years for his conduct in the management of four failed companies.  Mr Byer's ban follows the appointment of liquidators to four fashion apparel companies he managed: Mentmore Pty Ltd, 095 987 214 Pty Limited (formerly known as Bleach Pty Limited), 135 580 013 Pty Limited (formerly known as Ksubi Copyright Pty Ltd) and 140 672 797 Pty Limited (formerly known as Ksubi Pty Limited).
