Comments close 25 November 2016. This consultation paper sets out ASIC’s proposals to remake four of our class orders relating to registered schemes. Under the Legislation Act 2003, these class orders will expire (‘sunset’) if not remade. We are seeking feedback on our proposals to remake, without significant changes, the following class orders: Class Order [CO 98/50] Incorporating parts of other compliance plans, which is due to expire on 1 April 2018; Class Order [CO 98/60] Protecting class rights in a managed investment scheme, which is due to expire on 1 April 2018; Class Order [CO 98/1806] Related bodies corporate and external members of compliance committee, which is due to expire on 1 October 2017; and Class Order [CO 98/1808] Allowing constitutions to use Appendix 15A of the ASX Listing Rules,which is due to expire on 1 October 2017.
