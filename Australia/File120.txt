Note: APRA's policy is to publish all submissions on the APRA website unless a respondent expressly informs APRA in writing that all or part of the submission is to remain in confidence. Automatically generated confidentiality statements in emails do not suffice for this purpose. Where respondents would like only part of their submission to remain in confidence, they should provide this information marked as 'confidential' in a separate attachment.
