Comments due 9 September 2016. This consultation paper sets out ASIC’s proposals to remake three of our class orders on managed investment schemes. Under the Legislation Act 2003, these class orders will expire (‘sunset’) if not remade. We are seeking feedback from operators and promoters of managed investment schemes on our proposals to remake, without significant changes, the following class orders: Class Order [CO 02/210] Interests in film and theatrical ventures, which is due to expire on 1 April 2017;  Class Order [CO 02/211] Managed investment schemes: Interests not for money, which is due to expire on 1 April 2017; and  Class Order [CO 02/236] Film investment schemes, which is due to expire on 1 April 2017.
