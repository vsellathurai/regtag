supplementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments with regard to regulatory technical standards on transparency requirements for trading venues and investment firms in respect of shares, depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds, certificates and other similar financial instruments and the obligation for investment firms to execute transactions in certain shares on a trading venue or a systematic internaliser
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/20121, and in particular Articles 4(6), 7(2), 14(7), 20(3), 22(4) and 23(3) thereof,
Whereas:
A high degree of transparency is essential to ensure that investors are adequately (1)informed as to the true level of actual and potential transactions in shares, depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certificates and other similar financial instruments irrespective of whether those transactions take place on regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), systematic internalisers, or outside those facilities. This high degree of transparency should also establish a level playing field between trading venues so that the price discovery process in respect of particular financial instruments is not impaired by the fragmentation of liquidity, and investors are not thereby penalised.
At the same time, it is essential to recognise that there may be circumstances where (2)exemptions from pre-trade transparency or deferrals from post-trade transparency obligations should be provided to avoid the impairment of liquidity as an unintended consequence of obligations to disclose orders and transactions and thereby to make public risk positions. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify the precise circumstances
1 OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 84.
EN 6 EN
under which waivers from pre-trade transparency and deferrals from post-trade transparency may be granted.
The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with the (3)transparency requirements applicable to trading venues and investment firms in respect of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and efficient access for stakeholders, in particular those subject to the obligations, it is desirable to include these regulatory technical standards in a single Regulation.
Where competent authorities grant waivers in relation to pre-trade transparency (4)requirements or authorise the deferral of post-trade transparency obligations, they should treat all regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities and investment firms trading outside of trading venues equally and in a non-discriminatory manner.
It is appropriate to provide for clarification of a limited number of technical terms. (5)Those technical definitions are necessary to ensure the uniform application in the Union of the provisions contained in this Regulation and, hence, contribute to the establishment of a single rulebook for financial markets in the Union. Those definitions are purely functional for the purpose of setting out the transparency obligations for equity and equity-like financial instruments and should be strictly limited to understanding this Regulation.
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 brings within the scope of the transparency regime (6)equity-like instruments such as depositary receipts, ETFs and certificates, as well as shares and other equity-like instruments only traded on a MTF. It is necessary, in order to establish a comprehensive and uniform transparency regime, to update Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 of 10 August 20062 by calibrating the content of the pre-trade information to be made public by trading venues.
A trading venue operating a request for quote (RFQ) system should at least make (7)public all the firm bid and offer prices or actionable indications of interest and the depth attached to those prices no later than at the time when the requester is able to execute a transaction under the system’s rules. This is to ensure that members or participants who are providing their quotes to the requester first are not put at a disadvantage.
While this Regulation sets out the specific methodology and data necessary to perform (8)calculations for the purpose of specifying the transparency regime applicable to equity
2 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 of 10 August 2006 implementing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards recordkeeping obligations for investment firms, transaction reporting, market transparency, admission of financial instruments to trading, and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive (OJ L 241, 2.9.2006, p. 1).
EN 7 EN
and equity-like financial instruments, it should be applied in conjunction with Regulation (EU) No [RTS on Article 22 and Double Volume Cap] which specifies in more general terms, the common elements with regard to the content and frequency of data requests to be addressed to trading venues, Approved Publication Arrangements (APAs) and Consolidated Tape Providers (CTPs) for the purposes of transparency and other calculations.
This Regulation should ensure that the pre-trade and post-trade transparency regime (9)established by Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 is appropriately calibrated to the market. In particular, a static determination of the most relevant markets in terms of liquidity, the sizes of orders that are large in scale and standard market sizes would not adequately capture regular modifications of trading patterns affecting equity and equity-like instruments. Therefore, it is essential that this Regulation lays down the necessary calculations to be performed, including their periods and methods as well as the identification of the competent authority responsible for making the calculations in accordance with the determination of the relevant competent authority for the purpose of Article 26 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 specified in Article xx of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) [insert reference to Article 18 of RTS on reporting obligations under Article 26 of MiFIR]. In this respect, to avoid market distorting effects, the calculation periods specified in this Regulation should ensure that the relevant thresholds of the regime are updated at appropriate intervals to reflect market conditions. It is also appropriate to provide for the centralised publication of the results of the calculations so that they are made available to all financial market participants and competent authorities in the Union in a single place and in a user-friendly manner. To that end, competent authorities should notify ESMA of the results of their calculations and then ESMA should publish those calculations on its website.
It is also appropriate to ensure that the pre-trade and post-trade transparency regime (10)established by Regulation (EU) No 600/201 is applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union. In order to carry out the calculations for determining the requirements for the pre-trade and post-trade transparency in accordance with Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the content, frequency of data requests and the formats and timeframe in which trading venues, APAs and CTPs must respond to such requests in accordance with Article 22(4) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be developed. The results of the calculations made on the basis of the data collected according to Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 need to be published in order to inform market participants and achieve pre- and post-trade transparency in practice. It is also appropriate to provide for the possibility of centralised publication of the results of the calculations so that they are made available to all financial market participants and competent authorities in the Union in a single place and in a user-friendly manner. To that end, competent authorities should notify European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of the results of their calculations and then ESMA should publish those calculations on its website.
EN 8 EN
For ETFs, and contrary to shares, depositary receipts, certificates and other similar (11)financial instruments, the average daily turnover does not appear as an appropriate proxy for the calibration of the large in scale thresholds. For these instruments, the measure of actual liquidity is not adequately captured by the average daily turnover since the creation and redemption mechanisms inherent to ETFs allow to access additional and non-displayed liquidity. In order to reduce the risk of circumvention, it is also important that two ETFs on the same underlying have the same large in scale thresholds regardless of whether they have similar average daily turnover or not. Therefore, this Regulation should establish a single large in scale threshold for all ETFs which should apply regardless of their underlying or of their liquidity.
Information which is required to be made available as close to real time as possible (12)should be made available as instantaneously as technically possible, assuming a reasonable level of efficiency and of expenditure on systems on the part of the person concerned. The information should only be published close to the prescribed maximum time limit in exceptional cases where the systems available do not allow for publication in a shorter period of time.
Investment firms should make public the details of transactions executed outside a (13)trading venue through an APA. This Regulation should set out the way investment firms report the details of the transactions to APAs and should apply in conjunction with the Regulation on [RTS 13 on DRSP] where the specific requirements applicable to APAs are specified.
The transparency requirements aim to ensure that investors have reliable and timely (14)information about the level of trading interest in financial instruments. Information on certain types of transactions such as the transfer of financial instruments as collateral would not provide meaningful information to investors in respect of the level of genuine trading interest in a financial instrument. Requiring investment firms to make public those transactions would cause significant operational challenges and costs without improving the price formation process. Therefore, post-trade transparency obligations in respect of transactions executed outside a trading venue should only apply in the case of a purchase or sale of a share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument. It is essential that certain transactions such as those involving the use of any such instruments for collateral lending or other purposes where the exchange is determined by factors other than the current market valuation should not be published as they do not contribute to the price discovery process, would only blur the picture for investors and be a hindrance to achieving best execution.
Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, transactions executed on a trading venue (15)should be made public by market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue. In respect of transactions executed outside the rules of a trading venue, it is essential to clarify which investment firm should make public a transaction in cases where both parties to the transaction are investment firms established in the Union to ensure the publication of transactions without duplication. Therefore, the
EN 9 EN
responsibility to make a transaction public should always fall on the selling investment firm unless only one of the counterparties is a systematic internaliser and it is the buying firm.
Where only one of the counterparties is a systematic internaliser in a given financial (16)instrument and it is also the buying firm for that instrument, it should be responsible for making the transaction public as its clients would expect it to do so and it is better placed to fill in the reporting field mentioning its status of systematic internaliser. To ensure that a transaction is only published once, the systematic internaliser should inform the other party that it is making the transaction public.
It is important to maintain current standards for the publication of transactions carried (17)out as back-to-back trades to avoid the publication of a single transaction as multiple trades and to provide legal certainty on which investment firm is responsible for publishing a transaction. Therefore, two matching trades entered at the same time and for the same price with a single party interposed should be published as a single transaction.
The new legislation of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in (18)financial instruments set out in Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from the same date. However, to ensure that the new transparency regulatory regime can operate effectively from 3 January 2017, and that market participants have sufficient time to implement the new requirements by that date, it is necessary for certain transitional provisions to apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. These transitional provisions should enable the collection of data for the calculations and provide for an earlier publication of the most relevant markets in terms of liquidity, the sizes of orders that are large in scale, the deferred publication thresholds and standard market sizes.
This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the (19)European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.
ESMA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical (20)standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established by Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council3,

CHAPTER III
POST-TRADE TRANSPARENCY FOR TRADING VENUES AND INVESTMENT FIRMS TRADING OUTSIDE A TRADING VENUE
Article 12
(Article 6(1) and Article 20(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014)
Post-trade transparency obligations
1. Investment firms trading outside the rules of a trading venue and market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue shall make public, by reference to each transaction, the details set out in Tables 2 and 3 of Annex I and use each applicable flag listed in Table 4 of Annex I.
EN 19 EN
2. Where a previously published trade report is cancelled, investment firms trading outside a trading venue and market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue shall make public a new trade report which contains all the details of the original trade report and the cancellation flag as specified in Table 4 of Annex I.
3. Where a previously published trade report is amended, investment firms trading outside a trading venue and market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue shall make the following information public:
(a) a new trade report that contains all the details of the original trade report and the cancellation flag as specified in Table 4 of Annex I;
(b) a new trade report that contains all the details of the original trade report with all necessary details corrected and the amendment flag as specified in Table 4 of Annex I.
4. Where a transaction between two investment firms is concluded outside the rules of a trading venue, either on own account or on behalf of clients, only the investment firm that sells the financial instrument concerned shall make the transaction public through an APA.
5. By way of derogation to paragraph 4, if only one of the investment firms party to the transaction is a systematic internaliser in the given financial instrument and it is acting as the buying firm, only that firm shall make the transaction public through an APA, informing the seller of the action taken.
6. Investment firms shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the transaction is made public as a single transaction. For that purpose, two matching trades entered at the same time and for the same price with a single party interposed shall be considered to be a single transaction.
Article 13
(Article 20(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014)
Application of post-trade transparency to certain types of transactions executed outside a trading venue
The obligation in Article 20(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 shall not apply to the following:
(a) excluded transactions listed under Article 3(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No xxx/20xx [insert reference to RTS on obligation to report transactions] where applicable;
(b) transactions executed by a management company as defined in Article 2(1)(b) of Directive 2009/65/EC or an alternative investment fund manager as defined in Article 4(1)(b) of Directive 2011/61/EU which transfers the beneficial ownership of financial

Annex I: Information to be made public
Table 1
Description of the type of trading systems and the related information to be made public in accordance with Article 3
Type of trading system
Description of the trading system
Information to be made public
Continuous auction order book trading system
A system that by means of an order book and a trading algorithm operated without human intervention matches sell orders with buy orders on the basis of the best available price on a continuous basis.
The aggregate number of orders and the shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments that they represent at each price level for at least the five best bid and offer price levels.
Quote-driven trading system
A system where transactions are concluded on the basis of firm quotes that are continuously made available to participants, which requires the market makers to maintain quotes in a size that balances the needs of members and participants to deal in a commercial size and the risk to which the market maker exposes itself.
The best bid and offer by price of each market maker in shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments traded on the trading system, together with the volumes attaching to those prices.
The quotes made public shall be those that represent binding commitments to buy and sell the financial instruments and which indicate the price and volume of financial instruments in which the registered market makers are prepared to buy or sell. In exceptional market conditions, however, indicative or one-way prices may be allowed for a limited time.
Periodic auction trading system
A system that matches orders on the basis of a periodic auction and a trading algorithm operated without human intervention.
The price at which the auction trading system would best satisfy its trading algorithm in respect of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments traded on the trading system and the volume that would potentially be executable at that price by participants in that system.
Request for quote trading system
A trading system where a quote or quotes are provided in response to a request for quote submitted by one or more members or participants. The quote is executable exclusively by the requesting member or participant. The requesting member or participant may conclude a transaction by accepting the quote or quotes provided to it on request.
The quotes and the attached volumes from any member or participant which, if accepted, would lead to a transaction under the system’s rules. All submitted quotes in response to a request for quote may be published at the same time but not later than when they become executable.
EN 26 EN
Any other trading system
Any other type of trading system, including a hybrid system falling into two or more of the types of trading systems referred to in this table.
Adequate information as to the level of orders or quotes and of trading interest in respect of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments traded on the trading system; in particular, the five best bid and offer price levels and/or two-way quotes of each market maker in that instrument, if the characteristics of the price discovery mechanism so permit.
