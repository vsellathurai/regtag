Commonwealth Securities Limited (“CommSec”) has paid a total penalty of $700,000 to comply with two infringement notices given to it by the Markets Disciplinary Panel (“MDP”), and has voluntarily refunded $1.1 million in brokerage to more than 25,000 clients. The MDP had reasonable grounds to believe that CommSec contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act by reason of contravening: These rules relate to confirmations of transactions which require disclosures in relation to crossings and trading as principal.  A crossing occurs where a market participant acts for both the buyer and the seller in a transaction. Between 1 August 2010 and 13 February 2014, CommSec issued 114,841 confirmations to retail clients whose orders were executed as crossings but which did not contain the required statement that the transactions had involved a crossing, namely: Between 16 May 2011 to 13 February 2014, CommSec issued 50,484 confirmations to retail clients in relation to which CommSec had entered into transactions as principal but which did not contain the required statement that CommSec entered into the transactions as principal and not as agent, namely: The MDP specified a penalty of $400,000 for the alleged contraventions. CommSec voluntarily refunded approximately $1.1 million in brokerage to more than 25,000 clients, and notified 48,205 clients of the lack of disclosure and to provide corrective disclosure. CommSec also co-operated with ASIC throughout its investigation and did not dispute any material facts.

This rule requires a trading participant to maintain the necessary organisational and technical resources to ensure that, among other things, trading messages submitted by the participant do not interfere with the efficiency and integrity of the market. The MDP has reasonable grounds to believe that, between 2 August 2010 to 14 April 2013, CommSec did not have in place adequate organisational and technical procedures or controls that verified the name and address on an issuer sponsored holding matched that of the client who provided the instructions prior to submitting the orders for the sale of the holdings.
