In April 2016, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission commenced an investigation into the life insurance business of The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited, trading as CommInsure. The investigation relates to a range of concerns regarding CommInsure's life insurance business, including its claims handling practices and procedures. The investigation commenced following concerns raised in the media earlier this year. ASIC has undertaken an extensive range of enquiries into the concerns raised.
