The Federal Court of Australia yesterday made declarations that Sino Australia Oil and Gas Limited (in liq.) (Sino) and its former chairman, Mr Tianpeng Shao, contravened the Corporations Act. As part of its case, ASIC alleged that Sino breached its continuous disclosure obligations and made misleading and deceptive statements in its prospectus documentation during 2013. ASIC also alleged that Mr Shao failed to act with the proper degree of care and diligence as a Sino director and that he breached continuous disclosure laws. The Court declared that Sino had contravened sections 674(2), 728(1)(a), 728(1)(b), 728(1)(c),1041H of the Corporations Act, finding that it : In relation to Mr Shao, the Court declared that he contravened ss180(1) and 674(2A) of the Act, finding that he: In relation to Mr Shao’s approving prospectus documents in English despite not being able to speak or read the language and without obtaining a full Chinese translation, Justice Davies said: “Mr Shao as chairman of the Board signed off each of the prospectus documents….That required him to inform himself fully and comprehensively about the content of the prospectus documents to ensure that the information contained in those prospectus documents was accurate. The failure by Mr Shao to ensure that he could understand, even in the most basic sense, the content of the documents he was signing was a breach of his director’s duties.” ASIC Commissioner John Price said, 'The importance of providing accurate and timely information lies at the heart of our financial markets and those principles were breached in this case. This is a significant decision given these principles are vital to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our markets.' The Court will hear further submissions as to penalty on a date to be fixed.

In March 2014, ASIC obtained an injunction from the Federal Court of Australia freezing the Australian bank account of Sino following concerns that Mr Shao was attempting to transfer $7.5 million – representing almost the entire cash held by Sino in Australia – to bank accounts in China for purposes that were not disclosed, or not properly disclosed, in Sino’s prospectus documentation.
