 Number 2014-21 Date 2 December 2014 Embargo For Immediate Release Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent. Growth in the global economy is continuing at a moderate pace. China's growth has generally been in line with policymakers' objectives. While weakening property markets present a challenge in the near term, economic policies have been responding in a way that should support growth. The US economy continues to strengthen, but the euro area and Japan have both seen weakness recently. Some key commodity prices have declined significantly in recent months, reflecting somewhat softer demand and, more importantly, increased supply. Global financial conditions remain very accommodative and long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain very low. Differences in monetary policies across the large jurisdictions are affecting markets, particularly exchange rates. In Australia, most data are consistent with moderate growth in the economy. Resources sector investment spending is starting to decline significantly, while some other areas of private demand are seeing expansion, at varying rates. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued. Overall, the Bank still expects growth to be a little below trend for the next several quarters. Inflation is running between 2 and 3 per cent, as expected, with recent data confirming subdued rises in labour costs. Although some forward indicators of employment have been firming this year, the unemployment rate has edged higher. The labour market has a degree of spare capacity and it will probably be some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Hence, growth in wages is expected to remain relatively modest over the period ahead, which should keep inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate. Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and have continued to edge lower over the past year or so as competition to lend has increased. Investors continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth is moderate overall, but with a further pick-up in recent months in lending to investors in housing assets. Dwelling prices have continued to rise. The exchange rate has traded at lower levels recently, in large part reflecting the strengthening US dollar. But the Australian dollar remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices in recent months. A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy. Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years. In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

16.24 The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has today released final requirements for governance and risk management components of the framework for supervision of banking and insurance conglomerate groups (Level 3 framework). The new requirements will come into effect from 1 July 2017. APRA consulted on these requirements in March 2016 and received four submissions. Minor clarifications have been made in response to the feedback provided, with details included in a response letter that has also been released today. APRA previously announced its intention to apply the Level 3 framework to eight conglomerate groups (see: www.apra.gov.au/MediaReleases/Pages/14_15.aspx). APRA will formally determine the Level 3 Heads and members of each of the eight Level 3 groups between now and 1 July 2017 when these requirements take effect. APRA Chairman Wayne Byres said: ‘the group governance and risk management requirements released today will further strengthen conglomerate groups by enhancing oversight of group risks and exposures, and limiting potential contagion and systemic risks.’ APRA announced in March 2016 that it was deferring capital requirements for conglomerates until a number of other domestic and international policy initiatives are further progressed. APRA does not propose to initiate new consultations on the capital component of the conglomerate framework any earlier than mid-2017. The Level 3 framework, including prudential standards and prudential practice guides can be found on the APRA website at: www.apra.gov.au/CrossIndustry/Pages/Supervision-of-conglomerate-groups-L3-august-2016.aspx The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry.

A review by ASIC has found an overall improvement in the measures of cleanliness in the Australian listed equity market over the past decade. Report 487 Review of Australian equity market cleanliness, looked at possible insider trading and information leakage ahead of material, price-sensitive announcements (material announcements) by analysing price movements or shifts in trading behaviour before these announcements. The results of the review suggest that insider information and the loss of confidentiality ahead of material announcements has declined over the period. The review used two measures of market cleanliness to come to this conclusion: In a clean market, security prices should instantaneously react to new information released through the proper channels. Abnormal price movements and anomalous trading patterns ahead of announcements may indicate an ‘unclean market’. Measuring abnormal price movements forms the basis of the established market cleanliness measure. The new market cleanliness measure developed by ASIC examines timely and profitable trading before material announcements. It compares the trading behaviour of individual accounts to their historical trading behaviour and the trading of others in the market. Anomalous trading behaviour before an announcement is a significant indicator of confidentiality being breached or compromised. Based on the new measure, 95% of material announcements exhibited no (or negligible) anomalous trading patterns ahead of an announcement in the period 1 November 2014 to 31 October 2015. ASIC developed the new measure by leveraging its advanced surveillance system and data analysis capabilities. The review found: Independent international research ranks Australia market cleanliness favourably compared to other developed equities markets. ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour said the measure of market cleanliness was important to provide an overview of market integrity, one of ASIC's primary responsibilities. 'Market integrity is fundamental to well-developed financial markets. Given the significance of market integrity to financial markets and the broader economy, ASIC's strategic priority of ensuring fair and efficient markets is vitally important', she said. 'We have seen a gradual improvement in market cleanliness indicators over time and across different segments of Australia’s listed equities markets. ASIC will continue to monitor market cleanliness and enhance our surveillance and enforcement capabilities against market misconduct.'   an established market cleanliness measure that has been widely applied in regulatory and academic settings, and a new market cleanliness measure developed by ASIC. a general improvement in market cleanliness for the 10-year period from 1 November 2005 to 31 October 2015, and the established and new market cleanliness measures are positively correlated with each other, suggesting that the established method is useful for trend analysis. Read the full report

An ASIC review of risks related to the handling of confidential information and conflicts of interests, particularly in the provision of sell-side research and corporate advisory services, has found that most firms have policies and procedures in place to deal with these risks. However, there remain instances of poor and inconsistent practice in their application. Report 486 Sell-side research and corporate advisory: Confidential information and conflicts of interest details the review's findings and highlights areas of concern requiring a greater focus and care. Between September 2014 and June 2016, ASIC conducted reviews of the policies, procedures and practices of a range of investment banks and brokers active in the Australian market and reviewed a sample of transactions, including initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary offerings. This review followed on from previous monitoring and surveillance work undertaken by ASIC that had indicated some poor practices in these areas. While most firms have specific policies and procedures in place, the review found considerable variation in the following market practices: ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour said the purpose of the review was to understand current market practices and identify areas of particular concern. 'The proper handling of confidential information and the management of conflicts is a key element in preserving and promoting market integrity, improving market efficiency and increasing investor confidence,' she said. 'Where confidential information is mishandled or conflicts are not managed appropriately there is a risk that a breach of financial services laws may occur. This may include insider trading, market manipulation, misleading and deceptive conduct, and breaches by Australian financial services licensees of their general obligations. 'All firms should review this report and consider whether their controls – including policies, procedures, training and monitoring – are appropriate and sufficiently robust to meet legal and regulatory requirements', Ms Armour said. This report builds on previous work by ASIC on the handling of confidential information and the management of conflicts of interest. ASIC is also undertaking a review of the practices used by firms to market IPOs to investors other than institutions. This includes the use of social media and other platforms. This review will form the basis of a separate report, to be released later this year.   Identification and handling of confidential information: Some organisations do not have appropriate arrangements to handle situations where staff members come into possession of confidential information. This includes the inadequate use or supervision of information barriers and restricted trading lists. Management of conflicts of interest: There is an inconsistency in how conflicts of interest are managed. This includes the structure and funding of research, insufficient separation of research and corporate advisory activities (particularly the involvement of research in soliciting business during the IPO process), decisions about share allocations in capital raisings, and mixed practices in relation to the disclosure of conflicts of interest. Staff and principal trading: There is also considerable variation in the strength of controls to manage staff trading, including trading by corporate advisory and research staff. In particular, some questions remained as to whether the approval process adequately addressed the conflicts of interest, and whether a staff member might be in possession of confidential information. In mid-sized firms, it is more common for staff to participate in capital raising transactions that the firm is managing. This presents an increased risk of unacceptable or questionable activity that firms need to be aware of and manage.

ASIC today released a consultation paper proposing to remake its class orders on non-monetary consideration managed investment schemes, which is currently due to expire (‘sunset’) on 1 April 2017. ASIC proposes to remake the class orders as, in its view, the class orders are operating effectively and efficiently and continues to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework. The fundamental policy principles that underpin the class orders have not changed. It is proposed that the following class orders will be combined into a single new legislative instrument: All three class orders have been combined into a single instrument so that the substantive effect of the relief in each class order is continued beyond the expiration date in a new legislative instrument. The new instrument will continue the relief currently given by the class orders without significant changes, so that the ongoing effect will be preserved without any disruption to the entities that rely on it. Consultation Paper 266 Remaking ASIC class order on managed investment schemes: Not for money (CP 266) outlines ASIC's rationale for proposing to remake the instrument. The draft ASIC instrument, which reflects the amendments proposed in the consultation paper, is available on our website under CP 266. Submissions on CP 266 are due by 9 September 2016. Under the Legislation Act 2003, all class orders sunset after a specified period of time (mostly 10 years) unless we take action to exempt or preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant. All government organisations are responsible for considering whether the legislative instruments they have made that are due to sunset will be relevant after their sunset date.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has upheld ASIC's decision to permanently ban former credit representative, Shiv Sahay from providing financial services and engaging in credit activity. (refer: 15-284MR) On 22 October 2015, Mr Sahay applied to the AAT for a review of ASIC’s decision. On 9 August 2016, the AAT decided the permanent bans imposed by ASIC were appropriate in the circumstances. According to the AAT decision, Mr Sahay's conduct 'involved deliberate and repeated action by him to provide false information to lending authorities including the creation of false documents to support the applications lodged by him' and 'was irresponsible and significantly inconsistent with the orderly operation of the financial market.' In coming to the decision, the AAT took into consideration the need to protect the public from the conduct of Mr Sahay and the need to maintain the integrity of the financial services and credit industries to 'deter others from engaging in activity such as that being considered in this matter.'

 Number 2015-11 Date 7 July 2015 Embargo For Immediate Release Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent. The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, but some key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago. This trend appears largely to reflect increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling nonetheless. The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate later this year, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Hence, global financial conditions remain very accommodative. Despite fluctuations in markets associated with the respective developments in China and Greece, long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low. In Australia, the available information suggests that the economy has continued to grow over the past year, but at a rate somewhat below its longer-term average. The rate of unemployment, though elevated, has been little changed recently. Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. With very slow growth in labour costs, inflation is forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate. In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with stronger borrowing by businesses and growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates. The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar over the past year, though less so against a basket of currencies. Further depreciation seems both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board's assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

The Federal Court of Australia yesterday made declarations that Sino Australia Oil and Gas Limited (in liq.) (Sino) and its former chairman, Mr Tianpeng Shao, contravened the Corporations Act. As part of its case, ASIC alleged that Sino breached its continuous disclosure obligations and made misleading and deceptive statements in its prospectus documentation during 2013. ASIC also alleged that Mr Shao failed to act with the proper degree of care and diligence as a Sino director and that he breached continuous disclosure laws. The Court declared that Sino had contravened sections 674(2), 728(1)(a), 728(1)(b), 728(1)(c),1041H of the Corporations Act, finding that it : In relation to Mr Shao, the Court declared that he contravened ss180(1) and 674(2A) of the Act, finding that he: In relation to Mr Shao’s approving prospectus documents in English despite not being able to speak or read the language and without obtaining a full Chinese translation, Justice Davies said: “Mr Shao as chairman of the Board signed off each of the prospectus documents….That required him to inform himself fully and comprehensively about the content of the prospectus documents to ensure that the information contained in those prospectus documents was accurate. The failure by Mr Shao to ensure that he could understand, even in the most basic sense, the content of the documents he was signing was a breach of his director’s duties.” ASIC Commissioner John Price said, 'The importance of providing accurate and timely information lies at the heart of our financial markets and those principles were breached in this case. This is a significant decision given these principles are vital to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our markets.' The Court will hear further submissions as to penalty on a date to be fixed. Sino was the Australian holding company of a Chinese operating company providing specialised drilling services to the oil and gas industry. Sino was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange Limited on 12 December 2013 after raising approximately $13.6 million under an initial public offering (IPO). In March 2014, ASIC obtained an injunction from the Federal Court of Australia freezing the Australian bank account of Sino following concerns that Mr Shao was attempting to transfer $7.5 million – representing almost the entire cash held by Sino in Australia – to bank accounts in China for purposes that were not disclosed, or not properly disclosed, in Sino’s prospectus documentation.

The class orders affect the audit of proprietary companies and financial reporting by wholly-owned entities. The consultation paper also seeks feedback on ASIC guidance documents on audit relief and on reporting relief for wholly-owned companies. The class orders proposed to be remade under Consultation Paper 267 Remaking and repealing ASIC class orders on audit and financial reporting  (CP 267) are:   ASIC proposes to remake these class orders as, in our view, they are operating effectively and efficiently, and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.

A draft revised Regulatory Guide 115 Audit relief for proprietary companies, and revised pro formas referred to in the instruments, are also attached to CP 267 for comment. As well, ASIC is seeking feedback on existing ASIC guidance on financial reporting relief for wholly owned entities. The new instruments retain most elements of the existing class orders. However, following consultation with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), we are proposing to no longer allow companies which are regulated by APRA from obtaining the relief under the remade [CO 98/1418]. We understand that in practice, these entities do not currently rely on the relief. Finally, CP 267 proposes that Class Orders [CO 98/106] Financial reports of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts, which is due to expire on 1 October 2017,andClass Order [CO 99/1225] Financial reporting requirements for benefit fund friendly societies, which is due to expire on 1 October 2016, be repealed.

A former director of one of the Kleenmaid group of companies, Bradley Wendell Young was sentenced to nine years imprisonment last Friday after being found guilty by a District Court jury of 18 offences arising out of the collapse of the national whitegoods distributor.  Following a trial which lasted for 71 days, on 5 August 2016, the jury found Mr Young guilty of: The jury found Mr Young not guilty on one count of criminal insolvent trading.  Mr Young was sentenced to nine years imprisonment for the Westpac fraud and a total of three and a half years imprisonment for the insolvent trading charges. The court ordered that Mr Young's parole date in respect of the fraud be set at 5 February 2021 and for the insolvent trading charges was to be 21 months later.    At the time the offences were committed, Mr Young was the Managing Director of EDIS Service Logistics Pty Ltd, which, following a corporate restructure in November 2007, was licensed to import, wholesale and retail Kleenmaid appliances. Prior to the restructure, EDIS had been the spare parts distributor for Kleenmaid appliances.   During the trial, the court heard that it was Mr Young who proposed the plan whereby EDIS would obtain funding from Westpac to acquire inventory from Orchard KM Pty Ltd (formerly known as Kleenmaid Pty Ltd) which was the main trading company in the old Kleenmaid Group, and that at the time, Mr Young was aware of the dramatic loss-making and indebtedness of the Kleenmaid Group. The Crown's evidence was that Mr Young, along with fellow director Gary Collyer Armstrong failed to disclose to Westpac that EDIS and Orchard KM did not trade at arms-length and concealed the serious debt position of Orchard KM.  The court also heard that by the time administrators were appointed to the Kleenmaid group of companies, on 9 April 2009, Kleenmaid's consolidated debts amounted to approximately $96 million which included $26 million in customer deposits that had been paid for appliances yet to be delivered and that Kleenmaid's balance sheet deficit was approximately $83 million. In passing sentence, Judge Farr said '…insolvent trading…can wreak havoc on a business community' and '…you  showed a callous disregard for the fortunes of those affected by your behaviour in risking other people's money in extraordinary amounts.' 'This is a strong endorsement of ASIC's case, highlighting the severity with which such behaviour should be viewed and should send a signal to all directors and companies that we will pursue them through the courts when they break the law,' ASIC Commissioner John Price said. Following a plea of guilty, in October 2015, Mr Armstrong was sentenced to seven years imprisonment in relation to the $13 million Westpac fraud and the two Westpac criminal insolvent trading charges. Mr Armstrong was one of the witnesses called to give evidence for the prosecution during Mr Young's trial. Mr Armstrong will not be eligible for parole until 2 February 2018. See 16-248MR. A date is yet to be set in relation to the trial of the former Director and founder of Kleenmaid, Andrew Eric Young; Bradley Young's older brother. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions prosecuted the matter.   one count of fraud by dishonestly gaining loan facilities from Westpac Bank in November 2007 totalling $13 million; Two counts of criminal insolvent trading of debts totalling $3.5million relating to two additional loan facilities from Westpac Bank in July 2008; and 15 counts of criminal insolvent trading of debts totalling more than $750,000 that were incurred during the period October 2008 to April 2009.

The Federal Court in Perth has made interim orders against West Australian-based property developer Ms Desiree Veronica Macpherson and several Macro Realty Group companies of which she is a director and direct/indirect shareholder, following an application by ASIC on 21 July 2016. Initial ex parte orders were subject to a non-publication order by the Court. The companies subject to the orders are; ASIC obtained orders requiring Ms Macpherson to surrender to the Registry of the Court all passports held by her, any visa entitling her to enter, visit or reside in any country other than Australia and any airline ticket(s) for travel outside Australia until further order. The Court also made interim asset preservation orders against Ms Macpherson and the Macro Group as well as restraining her and the Macro Group from providing financial services advice, dealing in financial products, promoting financial products and otherwise carrying on a financial services business. Ms Macpherson can apply to vary the orders on a day's notice. ASIC made the application in order to protect the interests of shareholders, investors and creditors. The matters subject to these interim orders have been set down for a final hearing on 19 December 2016. ASIC's investigation is at an early stage, with a focus on investments in a land development in the Pilbara region of WA known as "The Newman Estate" that was subject to ASIC action and Federal Court permanent restraint orders in May this year. ASIC's investigation is ongoing. Earlier this year, the Federal Court in Perth permanently restrained the marketing and promotion of a proposed Pilbara property investment "The Newman Estate" by Macro Realty Developments Pty Ltd (Macro) and made declarations that Macro, Property Tuition Pty Ltd (21st Century Property) and Education Holdings Pty Ltd (21st Century Education) breached various provisions of the Corporations Act by promoting and marketing the investment proposal (refer: 16-092MR).

ASIC has banned Mr Nicholas Kerr, of Carindale, Queensland, from providing financial services for five years after finding that he engaged in unauthorised discretionary trading on his client accounts, provided inappropriate advice and created false records. Mr Kerr was a representative of Macquarie Equities Limited (MEL) from March 2008 to August 2013. ASIC's investigation found that during the period Mr Kerr was a representative of MEL, he engaged in discretionary trading on five client accounts.  MEL has prohibited its representatives from engaging in discretionary trading on behalf of clients since 2004. Mr Kerr breached the financial services laws by representing to those clients that he was authorised by MEL to operate a discretionary trading account in circumstances where he was not. ASIC also found that Mr Kerr created records on behalf of clients that falsely indicated that he had provided advice to the clients prior to trading when he had not, in circumstances where he had engaged in unauthorised discretionary trading. In addition, ASIC's investigation found that advice Mr Kerr provided to five of his clients was not appropriate to those clients, having regard to their personal circumstances. ASIC Commissioner Peter Kell said, 'Investors should feel confident that financial advisors are acting within the authority given to them by their licensee at all times and appropriately considering their interests. ASIC will act to remove advisors who fail to do so'. Mr Kerr has a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC's decision. This outcome is a result of ASIC's Wealth Management Project. The Wealth Management Project was established in October 2014 with the objective of lifting standards by major financial advice providers. The Wealth Management Project focuses on the conduct of the largest financial advice firms (NAB, Westpac, CBA, ANZ, Macquarie and AMP). ASIC's work in the Wealth Management Project covers a number of areas including: 1. working with the largest financial advice firms to address the identification and remediation of non-compliant advice; 2. seeking regulatory outcomes, where appropriate, against licensees and advisers. For example, as part of its Wealth Management Project, ASIC has banned the following advisers from the financial services industry, in addition to Mr Kerr: Discretionary trading is an arrangement by which a client gives a financial advisor the discretion to make investments on their behalf without the need to receive instructions from the client before each transaction. Under these arrangements, it is agreed that the financial advisor will use their investment expertise to generate a financial return for the client using the client's funds.

Class Order [CO 02/226] Managed investment schemes: no issue required disclosure was repealed as we consider it is no longer required and does not form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.  The repeal of the class order follows ASIC consultation in May 2016 (refer: Consultation Paper 259 Repealing ASIC class order on managed investment schemes: no issue required disclosure [CO 02/226]). No submissions were received. Under the Legislation Act 2003, legislative instruments such as class orders sunset after 10 years unless action is taken to exempt or preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant.

The Bank’s 2015/16 assessment will be published after it has been provided formally to the Assistant Treasurer and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The Board’s forthcoming 2015/16 annual report, which will be published once it has been tabled in Parliament. The Board also noted the annual review of compliance with its policy on management of potential conflicts of interest arising from the Bank’s commercial activities. The Board discussed work underway both internationally and domestically on a framework for the resolution of financial market infrastructures (FMIs). It was noted that, although robust risk management significantly reduces the likelihood of an FMI failing, the possibility of such failure is not entirely eliminated. A resolution regime supports the actions public authorities would take in such circumstances to foster financial stability and ensure the continued provision of critical services.

The Federal Court in Perth today banned Gary Stokes and Terence Quinn from managing corporations for three years and ordered they each pay a $25,000 fine for breaching their duties as directors of Padbury Mining Ltd (Padbury) with respect to the company's disclosure obligations. The decision comes as a result of civil penalty proceedings commenced by ASIC in June 2015 (refer: 15-156MR). The Court today made orders with the parties' consent. ruling that Padbury's announcement on 11 April 2014 that it had secured $6 billion in funding for the Oakajee port and rail project in Western Australia, was misleading and deceptive ('Announcement'). In the four hours between the Announcement and a trading halt, Padbury's share price (which was 2 cents before the Announcement) hit a high of 5.2 cents, with more than 200 million shares being traded. The judgment was handed down after the parties submitted an agreed statement of facts to the Court, along with submissions as to appropriate penalties in the circumstances of the case. The Court's findings included that: The court also ordered Stokes and Quinn each to pay a penalty of $25,000 and that they together pay $200,000 towards ASIC's costs in conducting the proceedings. In handing down his judgment, His Honour Siopis J said, 'the making of the declarations [of breach] serves to vindicate ASIC's claims that the defendants have engaged in contravening conduct and … serves to deter other corporations and directors from engaging in unlawful conduct.’ The Judge also said that the conduct of the two Directors 'was a serious departure from the standards expected of directors of a public company in a like situation', and that they had recognised this. His Honour further held that a three-year period of disqualification was an appropriate period, taking into account personal mitigating circumstances such as the Directors' cooperation with ASIC at an early stage of the proceedings. ASIC Commissioner John Price said, ‘It is crucial to the maintenance of confidence in the Australian market that company directors ensure announcements made by their companies are not misleading, and contain all material information relevant to investors' assessment of deals being announced. 'In this case the omission of significant conditions precedent and the identity of the funder were held to constitute breaches of the laws applying to listed companies,’ he said.

Former Victorian finance broker Rudy Noel Frugtniet's appeal against his permanent banning from engaging in credit activities has been dismissed by the Federal Court of Australia. ASIC permanently banned Mr Frugtniet, a former director of Unique Mortgage Services Pty Ltd (UMS), in July 2014 after it was found he provided misleading information and a lack of full disclosure on a credit licence application [refer: 14-163MR]. Mr Frugtniet appealed ASIC's decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in July 2014. On 6 March 2015, the AAT upheld ASIC's decision to permanently ban Mr Frugtniet from engaging in credit activities owing to his 'dishonest conduct over a prolonged period; his failure to show any real awareness of the nature, extent and significance of that conduct; and a demonstrated disregard for compliance with regulatory requirements' [refer: 15-049MR]. Mr Frugtniet filed an application in the Federal Court for a review of the AAT's decision on 8 April 2015. A hearing was held on 3 December 2015, where Mr Frugtniet represented himself.

ASIC has cancelled the registration of 133 approved self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) auditors who did not lodge their annual statements. On 28 July 2016, ASIC sent a final warning to 185 approved SMSF auditors with outstanding annual statements. ASIC had alerted these auditors on a number of occasions that their registration would be cancelled if their outstanding statements were not lodged with fees paid (see also 16-207MR ASIC warns 185 SMSF auditors to lodge annual statements or their registration will be cancelled). SMSF auditors have had ample time to come to grips with their responsibilities. Auditors who do not ensure that they are aware of and meet their obligations face the risk of losing their registration. An unregistered auditor is not permitted to audit an SMSF. Conducting an audit of an SMSF when not permitted to do so may have further serious consequences for the fund and the auditor. Approved SMSF auditors can confirm if they have lodged annual statements or update their contact details by accessing their ASIC Connect account. SMSF trustees and members can check whether their auditor is registered, or whether a person has been disqualified, by searching ASIC's SMSF Auditor register. From 1 July 2013, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 required all auditors of SMSFs to be registered with ASIC. This was to ensure that all SMSF auditors at least meet the base standards of competency and expertise. ASIC and the ATO work closely together as co-regulators of SMSF auditors. The ATO monitors SMSF auditor conduct and may refer matters to ASIC for possible action such as disqualification or suspension of their registration. Approved SMSF auditors need to lodge an annual statement with ASIC within 30 days of the annual anniversary of their registration. ASIC sends email notifications on anniversary dates advising that annual statements are ready for completion. If an extension of time to lodge the annual statement is required, a written request to ASIC must be made before the due date. An annual statement is not considered to be lodged until the required lodgement fee has been paid. ASIC notified 811 approved SMSF auditors that they had not met their annual statement requirement and that ASIC may cancel their registration. This included 95 auditors that had lodged annual statements but had not paid their lodgement fee. 626 auditors subsequently lodged their annual statement or paid outstanding fees. Changes to approved SMSF auditor contact details, including email and mailing addresses, must be provided to ASIC within 21 days of the change occurring. There is no fee to update these details. Approved SMSF auditors seeking to cancel their registration voluntarily can do so by completing a cancellation request form, available on ASIC's website. Further information can be found on ASIC's website and in ASIC Regulatory Guide RG 243 Registration of self-managed superannuation fund auditors (RG 243).     Background

R S Capital Partners Pty Ltd (RS Capital) has paid a $10,800 infringement notice penalty after making potentially misleading representations about the cost of setting up a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) using RS Capital's services. ASIC's concerns related to representations contained on the My SMSF Property website in February and March this year. The representations were that fund set up was free, however, conditions applied to the 'free' set up that were not clearly disclosed on the website.  ASIC was concerned that although advertised as 'free', conditions for fund set up included an accounting services fee of $1,100 per year for a minimum of two years.  ASIC Deputy Chair Peter Kell said, ‘Accuracy in advertising is integral to maintaining consumer trust and confidence in the SMSF sector. ASIC will continue to take action where we see advertising that might mislead consumers.' ASIC acknowledges that RS Capital immediately took steps to correct its advertising and is developing improved processes for the sign-off of advertisements. The payment of an infringement notice is not an admission of a contravention of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 consumer protection provisions.  ASIC can issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has contravened certain consumer protection laws. Since 1 July 2013, ASIC has received 218 reports of misconduct relating to SMSFs and real estate and/or property. In response to the growth in self-managed super funds, an increase in geared investment strategies and the parliamentary joint committee inquiry into the collapse of Trio, ASIC established the SMSF Taskforce.  The Taskforce meets regularly to examine high risk and emerging SMSF issues such as property spruiking to SMSFs, unlicensed conduct and misleading or deceptive advertising.  We have released guidance to improve the quality of advice provided by advisers on SMSFs, their costs and the risks associated with them.

The ASIC investigation looked at the conduct of My Adviser Pty Ltd (My Adviser), the holder of an Australian financial services licence, in relation to the supervision and monitoring of its representatives, in particular Arion Financial Pty Ltd (and its predecessor Sleipner Financial Pty Ltd) (collectively Arion). Arion was a financial advice business based on the Gold Coast in Queensland and was, from August 2012 to September 2014, a corporate authorised representative of My Adviser.

 Number 2015-13 Date 4 August 2015 Embargo For Immediate Release Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent. The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, but some key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago. Much of this trend appears to reflect increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling nonetheless. The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate later this year, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Hence, global financial conditions remain very accommodative. Despite fluctuations in markets associated with the respective developments in China and Greece, long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low. In Australia, the available information suggests that the economy has continued to grow. While the rate of growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages, it has been associated with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year. Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. Recent information confirms that domestic inflationary pressures have been contained. That should remain the case for some time, given the very slow growth in labour costs. Inflation is thus forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate. In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates. The Australian dollar is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices. The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Further information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board's ongoing assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

ASIC has banned Mr Anthony John Downey, of Brighton, Victoria, from providing financial services for a period of six years following an investigation. Mr Downey was, until 3 June 2015, a director of Platinum Mortgage Securities Limited. ASIC found that Mr Downey engaged in misleading conduct by providing false documents to support an application for an Australian visa, knowing that the documents would be provided to an Australian government department.

The Supreme Court of New South Wales has found that Macquarie Investment Management Ltd (MIML) contravened the Corporations Act by failing to comply with its duties as a responsible entity of the van Eyk Blueprint International Shares Fund (VBI Fund).  The Court made declarations of contravention and ordered that MIML pay a civil pecuniary penalty of $400,000, as well as $200,000 for ASIC's legal costs. The decision comes as a result of civil penalty proceedings brought by ASIC against MIML in June this year.  MIML admitted the contraventions and the parties filed a Statement of Agreed Facts and joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty (refer: 16-199MR).  The Court found that MIML failed to comply with its duties as a responsible entity by: Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, "This is a significant decision for investors and confirms the important role of responsible entities in monitoring and supervising funds, even where external managers are appointed. ASIC will take action when responsible entities fail to meet those obligations." Background ASIC has taken a number of actions to improve compliance by responsible entities and protect the interests of unit holders, investors and members (refer generally: 15-251MR). Other current and past actions include:   failing to exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were in MIML's position with respect to 3 investments totalling $30m into Cayman Islands based fund Artefact Partners Global Opportunities Fund (Artefact), between 6 July to 30 October 2012; allowing members to redeem or withdraw units from the VBI Fund when it was illiquid in contravention of the Corporations Act between 15 June 2013 to 9 September 2013; and failing to make adequate and timely enquiries in relation to van Eyk’s monitoring of the VBI Fund’s investment in Artefact between 18 February 2013 and 21 July 2014 (including not making adequate and timely enquiries as to why a full redemption from Artefact had not been paid between 1 January 2014 to 21 July 2014). Five former executives of MFS Investment Management Limited were found liable for breaching their duties as officers of a responsible entity, following $143.5 million of unitholders’ money used to repay debts. (16-158MR). Following the collapse of Gold Coast-based fund manager LM Investment Management, ASIC is seeking financial penalties and banning orders against director Peter Drake and former directors. ASIC alleges Mr Drake used his position to gain an advantage for himself and former directors breached their duties by failing to act with the proper degree of care and diligence. (14-308MR). ASIC is seeking court orders to wind up Avestra Asset Management and has alleged that on that Avestra contravened its duties in relation to a number of managed investment schemes for which it is the responsible entity.

Following an ASIC investigation, Mr Garry Leonard Matthews, a former director of Carrington Carpet Services Pty Ltd (Carrington), has been sentenced to three years jail after earlier pleading guilty to dishonestly and recklessly using his position as a director to cause detriment to the company. Mr Matthews, appearing before the Melbourne County Court today, was sentenced to serve 12 months in jail with two years suspended. Mr Matthews, of Darwin, used Carrington to operate a carpet business in Mount Waverley, Victoria. ASIC's investigation found that Mr Matthews used his position as the director of Carrington to authorise the withdrawal of numerous bank cheques totalling $1,075,300 belonging to Carrington for his personal use, unrelated to the carpet business operated by Carrington. As a result of Mr Matthews' conviction today, he is automatically disqualified from managing corporations for five years upon his release from jail.  ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, 'Company directors are required to act honestly and in the interests of the company they represent. The consequences of failing to discharge these obligations are serious, including jail and a lengthy disqualification from the management of companies'.

ASIC has made a new legislative instrument to replace three class orders on dollar disclosure that were due to expire (‘sunset’) on 1 October 2016 and 1 April 2017 respectively The new legislative instrument is ASIC Corporations (Disclosure in Dollars) Instrument 2016/767.  The instrument has the same effect as relief that ASIC had granted by Class Orders [CO 04/1431], [CO 04/1433] and [CO 04/1435].  It provides exemptions from the requirements to display in dollar amounts various costs, fees, charges, expenses, benefits and interests in Statements of Advice, Product Disclosure Statements and periodic statements, subject to the conditions in the instrument. ASIC consulted on its proposal to make the new legislative instrument through Consultation Paper 253 Remaking and repealing ASIC class order on dollar disclosure (CP 253), released on 29 February 2016.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has today released updated guidelines in relation to section 66 of the Banking Act 1959. Section 66 deals with the use of restricted terms in relation to banking services. Under section 66 and 66A of the Banking Act the use of a number of terms is restricted to those institutions that are authorised by APRA to carry on banking business. These terms include the use of ‘bank’, ‘banker’, ‘banking’, ‘building society’, ‘credit union’, ‘credit society’, ‘authorised deposit-taking institution’ and ‘ADI’. These terms are restricted for use only by authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) regulated by APRA to ensure potential customers are not misled into believing that non-APRA-regulated institutions have the same level of capital adequacy, depositor-priority and other prudential protections that apply to ADIs. The updated guidelines provide additional information for institutions not regulated by APRA, including information on activities that are likely to be considered ‘financial’; information that should be included in an application to use restricted terms; and the likely timeframes for APRA to consider an application. The updated guidelines issued today also clarify and confirm APRA’s existing policy and practice which restrict the use of the terms ‘banker’ and ‘banking’ by ADIs that are not banks. The Guidelines - Implementation of section 66 of the Banking Act 1959, have been updated by APRA following a consultation on draft revised guidelines issued in April 2013. The guidelines can be found on the APRA website at:  www.apra.gov.au/adi/Pages/adi-authorisation-guidelines.aspx. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry. It oversees Australia’s banks, credit unions, building societies, life and general insurance companies and reinsurance companies, private health insurers, friendly societies and most of the superannuation industry.

The Federal Court has today found that the directors of Storm Financial, Emmanuel and Julie Cassimatis, breached their duties as directors.  The Court also found that Storm Financial provided inappropriate advice to certain investors.  Since around 1994, Storm Financial operated a system created by the Cassimatises, in which ASIC considers "one-size-fits-all" investment advice was recommended to clients.  The advice recommended that clients invest substantial amounts in index funds, using "double gearing" (Storm Model).  This approach involved taking out both a home loan as well as a margin loan in order to purchase units in index funds, create a "cash dam" and pay Storm's fees.  Once initial investments took place, "Stormified" clients would be encouraged to take "step" investments over time. By the time of Storm's collapse in early 2009, approximately 3,000 of its 14,000 client based had been "Stormified".  In late 2008 and early 2009, many of Storm's clients were in negative equity positions, sustaining significant losses.  The case that ASIC advanced against the Cassimatises centered around a sample of investors who were advised to invest in accordance with the Storm Model.  ASIC alleged that the advice provided to those investors by Storm was inappropriate to their personal circumstances, considering that each of the investors were alleged to be over 50 years old, were retired or approaching and planning for retirement, had little or limited income, few assets and had little or no prospect of rebuilding their financial position in the event of suffering significant loss.  Among other things, it was also alleged that Storm failed to properly investigate the subject matter of the advice given to those investors.  As such, ASIC also alleged that Storm failed to do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by its licence were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly. ASIC further alleged that because the Cassimatises were responsible for the day-to-day significant decisions in relation to the provision of financial services to Storm's clients and exercised a high degree of control over its systems and processes, they had caused Storm to contravene its obligations under the Corporations Act and did not exercise their powers as directors of Storm with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would have exercised in that situation. In a 217 page judgment, Justice Edelman found that: Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, "This is an important decision which emphasises the importance of directors' duties to ensure that they do not cause the companies that they control, to breach the law.  The decision also highlights the significant obligation on financial services licensees to provide financial advice that is appropriate to the persons to whom it is given". The matter will be listed for a further hearing at a later date to determine what civil penalties and disqualification orders should be imposed on the Cassimatises as a result of the breach of their director duties. Background ASIC commenced this civil penalty proceeding against the Cassimatises in late 2010 (refer: 13-158MR).  The trial took place between 30 May and 30 June 2016. In May 2013 ASIC secured $1.1 million in compensation on behalf of two former Storm investors, Barry and Deanna Doyle (refer: 13-122MR). In September 2012, ASIC entered into a settlement agreement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to make available up to $136 million as compensation for losses suffered on investments made through Storm. The $136 million was in addition to payments of approximately $132 million, and other benefits that CBA had already provided to Storm investors under its Resolution Scheme (refer 12-227MR). In May 2013, ASIC intervened in the application for Court approval of the settlement of the related class action brought against Macquarie Bank in respect of Storm as it had concerns about the fairness of the settlement arrangements.  On 12 August 2013, the Full Federal Court agreed that the distribution of the settlement sum was not fair and reasonable to all group members (refer http://storm.asic.gov.au/settlements/richards-settlement/).  Under a revised settlement, Macquarie Bank agreed to pay $82.5 million by way of compensation and costs (refer 14-244MR). In September 2014, ASIC entered into a settlement agreement with the Bank of Queensland Limited to pay approximately $17 million as compensation for losses suffered on investments made through Storm (refer 14-244MR).    Storm provided advice to certain investors, that was inappropriate to their personal circumstances and failed to give such consideration to the subject matter of the advice and did not properly investigate the subject matter of the advice given. "A reasonable director with the responsibilities of Mr and Mrs Cassimatis would have known that the Storm model was being applied to clients such as those who fell within this class and that its application was likely to lead to inappropriate advice.  The consequences of that inappropriate advice would be catastrophic for Storm (the entity to whom the directors owed their duties).  It would have been simple to take precautionary measures to attempt to avoid the application of the Storm model to this class of persons."

ASIC has today released its guidance on providing digital financial product advice for retail investors: Providing digital financial product advice to retail clients (RG 255). The guide brings together some of the issues that digital advice providers need to consider when operating in Australia – from the licensing stage through to the actual provision of advice. RG 255 also includes guidance on some issues that are unique to digital advice, such as how the organisational competence obligation applies to digital advice licensees and the ways in which digital advice licensees should monitor and test their algorithms. ASIC's Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'ASIC is committed to encouraging innovation that may benefit consumers. Our guidance on regulating digital advice is a useful starting point for those providing or intending to provide digital advice in Australia. 'ASIC supports the development of a healthy and robust digital advice market in Australia as a convenient, low-cost option for retail clients, and our guidance will help ensure that consumers can have confidence when they deal with digital advice providers,' he said. ASIC recognises that digital advice continues to be developing area and digital advice providers are encouraged to contact ASIC if they have questions. Digital advice (also known as ‘robo-advice’ or ‘automated advice’) is the provision of automated financial product advice using algorithms and technology and without the direct involvement of a human adviser. It can comprise general or personal advice, and range from advice that is narrow in scope (for example, advice about portfolio construction) to comprehensive financial product advice. The provision of digital advice has grown rapidly in Australia since 2014, with a number of start-up AFS licensees and existing AFS licensees developing digital advice models. This growth is expected to continue. ASIC supports the development of a healthy and robust digital advice market. In an environment where only around 20% of adult Australians seek personal advice, we think that digital advice has the potential to offer an attractive, convenient and low-cost advice service to retail clients who may not otherwise seek advice. In March 2016, ASIC released Consultation Paper 254 Regulating digital financial product advice (Refer: CP 254) which attached a draft Regulatory Guide on regulating digital advice and sought feedback on a number a proposals in relation to our draft guidance. The consultation period for CP 254 closed in May 2015 and we received 38 submissions.

ASIC notes the decision by ASX-listed Melbourne IT Limited (Melbourne IT) to account for certain changes in the value of convertible notes through profit and loss in its financial report for the half-year ended 30 June 2016. ASIC made inquiries about Melbourne IT’s financial report for the year ended 31 December 2015. Melbourne IT had previously recognised movements in the fair value of embedded derivatives that are a part of its convertible note assets in other comprehensive income rather than profit and loss. In its financial report for the half-year ended 30 June 2016, Melbourne IT has changed its accounting to recognise the fair value movements of embedded derivatives correctly in profit and loss. Although the fair value movements for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 were small, the profit would have been increased by $510,000 at 31 December 2015 and the impact in future periods could be more significant. As outlined in ASIC media release 16-174MR ASIC calls on directors to apply realism and clarity to financial reports, financial instrument recognition and measurement remains a focus area of our financial reporting surveillance program. ASIC reminds companies and those involved in preparing and approving financial reports to pay close attention to the rights and obligations attached to financial instruments when determining the classification and measurement of complex financial instruments.

ASIC notes the decision by Energy Resources of Australia Limited (ERA) to make a $161 million impairment charge to non-current assets for the Ranger mine in its financial report for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 (30 June 2016 report). ASIC reviewed ERA's 31 December 2015 financial report as part of its ongoing financial reporting surveillance program and questioned the use of a single discount rate to the different components of the forecast cash flows in testing assets and liabilities for the Ranger mine for impairment. ERA maintains that its 31 December 2015 financial report complies in all respects with the Corporations Act and Australian accounting standards.  ERA has stated in its 30 June 2016 report that continued decline in the uranium oxide spot price was an indication of impairment at 30 June 2016. Impairment testing on the Ranger cash generating unit showed that the carrying amounts exceeded fair value. ERA also stated that external and business-specific factors in the six months to 30 June 2016 warranted a review of, and revision to the valuation technique used to determine fair value. Due to sustained weakness in the uranium market and the remaining life of current operations now being less than 5 years (in the absence of an Authority extension), ERA considers that the probability of a market participant utilising a more sophisticated valuation method is increasing.  Consequently, ERA has determined different discount rates for current operations, rehabilitation cash flows and the Ranger 3 Deeps development option. As outlined in ASIC media release 15-331 MR Focus areas for 31 December 2015 financial reports, impairment testing and asset values remain a focus area of our financial reporting surveillances.

ASIC has banned the former director of a payday lender, Peter Elfyd Llewellyn of Queensland, from engaging in credit activities for a period of ten years. Mr Llewellyn was banned following an investigation by ASIC into his conduct as a director of PR Finance Group Ltd (in liquidation) (PRFG) and Australian Money Exchange (in liquidation) (AMX). ASIC found that AMX engaged in unlicensed credit activity during the period 1 July 2011 to 23 September 2013. AMX attempted to avoid the requirement to be licensed by structuring short term loans to avoid the application of the National Credit Code. AMX charged fees on short term loans which were in excess of the limits imposed by the National Credit Code. ASIC also found that Mr Llewellyn was knowingly involved in AMX's unlicensed credit activity because, among other things, Mr Llewellyn participated in substantial decisions regarding business and legal issues affecting AMX. ASIC also found that Mr Llewellyn was not a fit and proper person to engage in credit activities. Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'The safeguards in the National Credit Code are designed to protect vulnerable consumers. ASIC will take action against persons who deliberately seek to avoid these obligations.' Mr Llewellyn has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC's decisions.  During the relevant period, AMX operated its business in Queensland and New South Wales, through branches located in Beenleigh, Caboolture, Darwin, Gosford, Liverpool, Mayfield, Rockhampton, St Marys, Stones Corner and Warrawong.   Section 29 of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 provides that a person must not engage in a credit activity if the person does not hold a licence authorising the person to engage in the credit activity. Section 6 of the National Credit Code provides that a person engages in a credit activity if the person carries on a business of providing credit that is credit of the type covered by the National Credit Code. The National Credit Code does not apply if the maximum amount of fees and charges does not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of credit. However, fees or charges payable for 'any service related to the provision of credit' are included in the calculation of the maximum amount. AMX provided short term loans to customers in the form of a cheque. The loan fee for the loan was 5 per cent of the loan principal. AMX also charged a cheque cashing fee of 16 per cent of the loan principal. ASIC found that the cheque cashing fee of 16 per cent of the loan principal was a fee or charge payable for a service related to the provision of credit. Accordingly the total fees and charges for short term loans provided by AMX was 21 per cent (which exceeded the 5 per cent threshold). Therefore the National Credit Code applied to AMX and AMX was required to be licensed during the period 1 July 2011 to 23 September 2013. In October 2013, AMX was placed into administration and in May 2015, was placed into liquidation.     Background

FINDING SUCCESS IN FAILURE
WAYNE BYRES
Chairman
Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
Actuaries Institute Banking Conference
‘Banking on Capital’
30 August 2016
Sydney 

FINDING SUCCESS IN FAILURE
Thank you for the invitation to be part of today’s event. The Actuaries Institute’s increasing
engagement on banking-related matters is a welcome development and, as was the case
last year, I’m happy to support it. I am, however, going to risk the ire of the organisers by
straying somewhat from the theme of today’s event: rather than ‘banking on capital’, I’m
going to talk about why a sole reliance on capital is an unwise strategy.
As you all know, over the past couple of years, there has (quite justifiably) been a great
deal of attention given to the implications of the first recommendation of the Financial
System Inquiry (FSI): that APRA should set capital standards such that Australian authorised
deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) would have capital ratios that are seen to be
‘unquestionably strong’. Since that recommendation was published, much has been written
about what it means – and given that it will be a little while before APRA is in a position to
make a final determination on how we best meet this recommendation, no doubt much more
will be. Today, I’ll simply repeat the point I’ve made previously: that the steady
accumulation of capital remains a sensible course of action for most ADIs.
It’s always important to remember, though, that a stable and resilient banking system is not
just delivered by more capital. Capital adequacy is a relative concept – is capital adequate
relative to risk? When we judge a bank’s capital to be high or low, or something in the
middle, we are making a judgement that takes into account a range of issues that impact
on bank risk profiles: funding and liquidity, asset quality, governance, risk management and
risk culture, to name a few, all come into the equation in some way or another.
We also need to remember there are no guarantees. No level of capital (short of 100 per
cent equity funding) can provide creditors with an absolute guarantee against the possibility
of bank failure. To pick up today’s theme, we can’t always ‘bank on capital’: something can
always go wrong. To attempt to provide the community with an iron clad guarantee that
nothing can go awry would require severe limitation on the risk-taking ability of the banking
system, and prevent it from fulfilling the vital and productive roles that it plays in
intermediating between borrowers and lenders and facilitating the smooth functioning of
payments throughout the economy. Put simply, a zero failure regime is not desirable.
Inevitably, we need to find a balance.1 One implication of that is, even once we define and
achieve ‘unquestionably strong’, we won’t be downing tools. In a world of fractional reserve
banking, ‘unquestionably strong’ will never equate to ‘invincible’.
That in turn means we need to think about failure.2 And when I use the word ‘failure’, I’m
not just talking about a classic case of insolvency or bankruptcy, but using it more broadly
to capture situations in which the on-going viability of one or more financial institutions is
in serious jeopardy.
The failure of a bank is not like the failure of a bakery. The potential for contagion to other
financial firms, not to mention the widespread adversity it can impose on the broader
community, means the failure or near-failure of a bank is no run of the mill matter. So, if
we start with the proposition that failures are inevitable, then I’d suggest the regulatory
1     The need for balance is recognised in our enabling legislation, the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority Act 1998, which requires APRA to balance financial safety and financial stability with considerations
of competition, efficiency, contestability and competitive neutrality. It is also recognised in the Statement of
Expectations that the Government sets for APRA, which acknowledges that it is not possible or efficient for APRA
to eliminate all risks, and that trade-offs in risk reductions are necessary. That expectation applies not just to
banks, but to all industries APRA regulates.
2     
It also means, by the way, that not every failure will necessarily imply a failure of the regulatory regime. 
system needs to be assessed against two benchmarks: are failures nevertheless sufficiently
rare, and do we have mechanisms to handle them adroitly when they occur? If the answer
to both these questions is yes, then community confidence and trust in the financial system
is likely to remain high.
With that in mind, we can think of two basic types of failure: orderly and disorderly.
To the extent we have failures, orderly failures are what we aspire to. Orderly failures will
typically have been anticipated, produce no loss to protected beneficiaries,3 and be
managed in such a way that the firm’s critical functions are maintained without disruption
while the situation is resolved. (Shareholders and other providers of capital of the nonviable firm may very well lose out along the way, but that is their lot in life.)
To the extent any failure can be regarded as a success, then an orderly exit from the industry
in this fashion is what we should strive for. For example, a firm that identifies it is
approaching non-viability or a strategic dead-end, and seeks to merge with a stronger and
more viable entity (sometimes with a nudge along the way from APRA) is a far from
uncommon event in the Australian financial system. To the extent such exits can be classed
as failures, or at least near failures, they are often so orderly that no one notices them.
Disorderly failures, on the other hand, are to be avoided. Disorderly failures will be those
which catch everyone by surprise, impose significant losses on those who the regulatory
framework seeks to protect, and/or involve significant disruption to the smooth operation
of the financial system, and economic activity more generally. HIH Insurance would be the
classic of this genre.
So what can we do to maximise the probability that failures will be orderly, rather than
disorderly? I’d suggest there’s a number of preconditions that the public sector needs to put
in place: 4           
? active supervision is at the heart of identifying the risk of failure early – it will be hard
to anticipate problems if there is no one looking for them in the first place;                                                      
? powers to intervene must exist – this is critical to being able to address small problems
before they become big ones;                    
? a willingness to intervene is also critical – powers are of no value if there is no capacity
or willingness to use them when needed5;                          
? planning and preparation – ideally, contingency plans will have been prepared and
tested in ‘peace time’ rather than thought up on the run in the midst of a crisis;
3     
Beneficiaries in this context refers to those creditors of a regulated entity that APRA is tasked with
protecting: ADI depositors, insurance policyholders and superannuation fund members. They can be thought of
as the primary beneficiaries of APRA’s activities.
4     
That is not to imply the responsibility rests solely with the public sector. APRA’s supervisory philosophy is
built on the premise that the primary responsibility for the prudent management of a regulated firm rests with
its board and management.
5     
Being willing to use powers can be easier said than done. In an impending failure, information on the state
of the firm will likely involve a great deal of uncertainty, and while early action is almost always the best course
of action, acting too early can bring legal risks with it. Key to having appropriate powers, therefore, is not just
the extent to which the powers exist in statute, but also having as much clarity as possible as to how and when
they can be used so that regulators can use the powers as intended with confidence. 
? a capacity to maintain critical functions – an orderly resolution of a failure may take
time, yet critical functions need to be maintained in the meantime; and                                                     
? there will ideally be a safety net or backstop to provide additional confidence at a time
of uncertainty – which will help avoid actions that are individually rational but
collectively damaging (the typical case being a bank run).
APRA, along with our colleagues amongst the Council of Financial Regulators, has spent a
great deal of time in recent years looking in a fairly hard-nosed way at how well Australia
stacks up against these preconditions. The conclusion was somewhat mixed: there are no
glaring deficiencies, but a number of areas for improvement.                                  
? The importance of active supervision, and a willingness to intervene where
appropriate, were some of the hard lessons that APRA took to heart following the HIH
episode. Justice Owen found APRA under-resourced to identify problems, and slow to
respond to them once found. These were fair conclusions, and APRA worked hard under
my predecessor to build both its capacity and conviction. Fifteen years on from HIH,
efforts to further improve our supervision – to identify risks early and respond promptly                                                         
– remain at the forefront of our latest strategic plan, and I expect they will always
feature prominently in APRA’s priorities.                         
? When it comes to powers to intervene, the FSI’s Final Report noted there are some
gaps and deficiencies in the Australian statutory framework for crisis management and
resolution when compared with international standards.6 This includes the need for such
things as broader investigation powers; strengthened directions powers; improved group
resolution powers; enhanced powers to deal with branches of foreign banks; and more
robust immunities to statutory and judicial managers. In his speech last week, the
Treasurer noted the Government’s intention to make improvements in this area, which
we see as a very valuable (and low cost) investment in the stability in the financial
system.  
? Crisis planning is critical. Last year at this event I spoke about our plans for recovery
and resolution planning. During the past year, I’m pleased to say larger ADIs have
submitted new plans based on updated guidance issued by APRA, and we are now
reviewing and benchmarking the plans in order to highlight areas of better practice that
will further increase the credibility of plans in subsequent iterations.7 On resolution
planning, more detailed work is also underway with specific firms to consider the
planning required to ensure that APRA is able to use our resolution powers when needed.
Our focus here is on the assessment of critical functions, intra-group dependencies such
as critical shared services, and the identification of potential barriers to resolvability.                                                         
? No matter how good the plan, however, stabilising and restructuring a financial firm
that is no longer viable in its current form is rarely going to be a quick and easy exercise.
So it is important that, while a resolution plan is being implemented, the firm’s critical
functions can be maintained so as to reduce potential losses and minimise the
disruption to the broader financial system. Key to doing this is that the firm has the
financial resources to allow it to continue to operate while its business is reorganised.
6     
The relevant benchmark is the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes.
7     
APRA will also be working with large insurers on recovery planning in 2017, following the industry stress
tests this year. 
Searching for new capital when a business is distressed, and time is of the essence, is
ideally to be avoided. And we want to minimise the risk that the taxpayer has to come
to the rescue. With that in mind, the post-crisis regulatory framework has built
mechanisms that trigger automatic corrective action to help restore a firm’s capital
when it has been diminished. There is a lot of discussion and debate on the merits of
so-called bail-inable instruments and bail-in powers, including in response to the FSI’s
third recommendation that APRA implement a framework for recapitalisation capacity
sufficient to facilitate the orderly resolution of an Australian ADI and minimise taxpayer
support. But the idea of bail-in is not something completely new: certain
recapitalisation mechanisms already exist in the Australian framework. Examples
include:
o the use of the capital conservation buffer, which imposes increasing limitations on
a ADI’s ability to make discretionary distributions to capital providers and employees
as the ADI approaches its minimum regulatory requirements;8
o the trigger that exists in Additional Tier 1 instruments (often referred to as
‘hybrids’) that provide for the instrument to be written off, or converted to equity,
in the event that an ADI’s capital ratio falls below 5.125 per cent; and
o the point of non-viability trigger in both Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments,
which provides for the instruments to be written off or converted to equity in the
event that APRA considers that the ADI would become non-viable without such
action (or some other form of support).
These latter two recapitalisation mechanisms, in particular, are designed to provide
some ‘breathing space’ to allow for orderly resolution. They are not designed to deliver
resurrection, but more modestly to provide scope for an ADI’s services to customers to
continue while new owners and managers are being put in place. Strengthening this by
increasing loss absorption and recapitalisation capacity further, as recommended by the
8     
The capital conservation buffer is, for most ADIs, a minimum of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets (3.5 per
cent in the case of an ADI that APRA has deemed a domestic systemically important bank). The buffer may
be extended by up to an additional 2.5 per cent (ie to 5.0 per cent, or 6.0 per cent for DSIBs) through the
use of the countercyclical buffer. At present, the countercyclical buffer component is zero in Australia,
although ADIs with operations overseas may be required to hold additional buffer if authorities in foreign
jurisdictions have applied a non-zero buffer to exposures within their jurisdiction.
In cases where an ADI does not hold sufficient CET1 to meet its minimum prudential capital requirement (PCR)
plus its required conservation buffer (CB), the ADI is limited in the extent to which it may make discretionary
distributions - typically, dividends on ordinary shares, distributions on Additional Tier 1 instruments, and
discretionary payments to staff - in accordance with the following table (which shows the relevant ranges in
instances when the total buffer is 2.5 per cent, and when the buffer is increased to 3.5 per cent). As noted,
these ranges will increase whenever the countercyclical capital buffer is applicable.

FSI, remains a work in progress and likely to take some time to complete. We are, as I
have said elsewhere, hastening slowly in response to that recommendation given the
importance of getting the policy settings right.
However, the new mechanisms that have already been instituted within existing capital
instruments are a very important part of the new regulatory framework. Viewing these
capital instruments as simply higher-yielding substitutes for vanilla fixed-interest
investments, let alone deposits, is something to be counselled against, since from
APRA’s perspective holders of these instruments are providing the important first lines
of defence that we can call into action, in some instances even ahead of shareholders,
to aid an orderly resolution.               
? Finally, despite these new mechanisms, having a safety net or backstop to provide
additional confidence before and during a period of resolution is an important
component of any resolution framework. Australian depositors have long had the benefit
of the depositor preference provisions in the Banking Act 1959. In 2008, this was
supplemented by the Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) which seeks to provide certain
depositors with prompt access to their funds – up to $250,000 per account holder - in
the event an ADI fails.9
But to achieve a prompt payout of protected deposits to account holders – something
depositors must be confident of for the backstop to work as intended – requires that
ADIs be operationally ready, prior to any failure, to meet payment, reporting and
communication requirements for the FCS.10 Planning and investing to facilitate their
own demise is something that financial firms inevitably struggle to do, so APRA will be
reinforcing its expectations in relation to ADI’s FCS testing programs in the near future,
with a view to ensuring there is genuine readiness to activate the FCS if it is ever
needed.
Concluding remarks
Adequate capital is undoubtedly critical to the stability of any banking system. But to return
to today’s theme, we can’t solely ‘bank on capital’ to deliver safety and stability. If we
accept that failures, while hopefully still reasonably rare, are nevertheless inevitable, then
preparation to minimise their impact is an essential investment. ‘Successful failures’ might
seem a contradiction in terms, but they are far better than the alternative.
9     
The general insurance component of the FCS covers most claims up to $5000. Claims above $5000 are also
covered for eligible policyholders and certain third parties.
10    
For depositors to be confident in the backstop, they also need to be aware of it in the first place. APRA
has recently launched a new website – www.fcs.gov.au – to give the FCS greater prominence, and provide the
community with improved understanding about how the FCS works.

Following public consultation, ASIC has released a new legislative instrument on horse schemes, replacing three class orders on horse racing syndicates and horse breeding schemes that were due to expire (‘sunset’). ASIC has replaced the following class orders with a new legislative instrument: The relief provided under all three class orders has been combined into a single instrument. The horse scheme class orders have been remade without fundamental changes so that the effect of the relief provided by the class orders will be preserved without any disruption to those who rely on them. The class orders have been repealed. The key changes made to the terms of the relief for horse racing syndicates are: In relation to horse breeding schemes, no significant changes were made to the terms of the relief. We have also updated Regulatory Guide 91 Horse racing and breeding to reflect the terms of the new legislative instrument. On 13 November 2015, ASIC released Consultation Paper 242 Remaking ASIC class orders on horse racing syndicates and horse breeding schemes, which publicly consulted on proposals to remake our class orders on horse racing syndicates and horse breeding schemes (refer 15-335MR). In CP 242, ASIC proposed to remake the class orders without fundamental changes. The report on submissions is attached. This report highlights the key issues from the submissions and ASIC's responses. ASIC received seven submissions, which raised a range of issues. Submissions received were generally supportive of ASIC’s proposal to remake the class orders without fundamentals changes in the form of the draft instruments attached to the consultation paper. Under the Legislation Act 2003, all class orders sunset after a specified period of time (mostly 10 years) unless we take action to exempt or preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant. All government organisations are responsible for considering whether the legislative instruments they have made that are due to sunset will be relevant after their sunset date.

Date 1 September 2016 Australia's new $5 banknote enters circulation today. Issuance is being supported by an information campaign to ensure that the Australian public is able to identify the new banknote and its security features. The Governor, Glenn Stevens, said: ‘The new $5 banknote has a range of security features that have not previously been used on an Australian banknote and that will help to keep our banknotes secure against counterfeiting into the future. New features include a world-first clear top-to-bottom window and a number of dynamic features that change as the banknote is tilted. The new banknotes are the culmination of many years of research and trial and extensive consultation with subject-matter experts and the cash-handling industry, as well as qualitative research involving focus groups.’ The $5 banknote is the first in a new series and other denominations will be upgraded over coming years. Each banknote in the series will incorporate the same security features. Additionally, they will each feature a different species of Australian wattle and a native bird within a number of distinctive elements. The new $5 banknote features the Prickly Moses wattle and the Eastern Spinebill. The new series also includes a ‘tactile’ feature to help the vision-impaired community distinguish between different banknote denominations. The tactile feature on the $5 banknote is one raised bump on each of the long edges of the banknote next to the top-to-bottom window. Key design aspects of the existing series of banknotes, such as the colour, size and people portrayed on each denomination, have been maintained. This will help the public recognise the new banknotes as they come into circulation. The existing $5 banknote will be progressively withdrawn from circulation but can continue to be used as usual. All previously issued banknotes remain legal tender. It will take some time for the new banknotes to be widely circulated. Further information on the new banknote, including a video explaining the new features, can be found at www.banknotes.rba.gov.au.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has rejected an application from IMS FX Services Pty Ltd (IMS FX) that sought confidentiality orders and an interim order that prevented ASIC from amending the public Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence register to record that ASIC had cancelled IMS FX’s AFS licence. The interlocutory application was made pending an AAT appeal to overturn ASIC’s decision to cancel its AFS licence, which is now awaiting listing by the AAT. The AAT said, "In the circumstances, I am satisfied that there is considerable risk to the public if the Decision is stayed. I consider that there is considerable merit in ASIC’s submission that the asserted misleading character of the application made by the Applicant goes to the heart of the risk to the public of allowing the Applicant to continue under its AFSL. "Furthermore, there is, as submitted by ASIC, a further aspect of the public interest which lies in the general deterrent effect of [ASIC] publicising the fact that an AFSL obtained by means of a materially misleading application has been cancelled - which supports the role of ASIC in carrying out its function of protecting the public.’ In light of the AAT’s decision, the AFS licence register will now reflect that IMS FX’s AFS licence has been cancelled. Deputy Chairman, Mr Peter Kell said, 'It is paramount that any person seeking to obtain an AFS licence submits an application that accurately reflects the facts and circumstances as well as the financial services business the applicant intends to carry on under the licence. 'This should be a salient reminder to applicants that should any material circumstances surrounding the application change, the applicant has a responsibility to disclose this to ASIC to ensure that ASIC’s decision is made on a fully informed and accurate basis. A failure to do so risks ASIC taking regulatory action, including, as in this instance, ASIC deciding to cancel the licence.’ ASIC notes that its' decision in this case is consistent with the Commonwealth Government’s support of Recommendation 29 of the Financial System Inquiry – that ASIC approval should be required for any change in control of a licensee. On 25 March 2015, IMS FX lodged an application for an AFS licence which was granted on 16 September 2015. Subsequently, ASIC learned that the controllers of the licensee had reached an agreement on 7 August 2015 that IMS FX would be sold shortly after the licence is granted. As the licence application did not disclose this intention to change ownership, directorships, intended business activities and resources, on 22 December 2015, ASIC convened a hearing to determine whether the licence should be cancelled. The hearing took place on 3 February 2016 and an ASIC delegate found that the application lodged with ASIC was misleading in a material way and decided to cancel the licence. The decision to cancel IMS FX’s licence was notified to the applicant on 24 February 2016. On 26 February 2016, IMS FX appealed ASIC’s decision and also sought to defer the effect of ASIC's cancellation order and confidentiality orders. An interlocutory hearing was held on 11 March 2016 and on 31 August 2016, the AAT made a decision rejecting IMS FX's interlocutory application.     Background

New online resources – the Divorce and Separation Financial Checklist and the Asset Stocktake Calculator – developed by ASIC will help people navigate the financial aspects of divorce and separation. The resources are designed to help Australians manage their finances and make informed financial choices to avoid financial pitfalls during periods of significant change in their life. The divorce and separation financial checklist and asset stocktake calculator will provide guidance on: 'A relationship breakdown changes many aspects of a person's life, including their finances. This can leave people feeling stressed and overwhelmed and make it difficult to focus on financial decisions', said Mr Peter Kell, ASIC Deputy Chairman. 'The new resources can help sort out money issues and guide people through the financial uncertainty they may be facing when a relationship ends, by providing practical steps to separate finances,' added Mr Kell. Research undertaken by the Australian Institute of Family Studies has measured the impact of a relationship breakdown on people's finances, which especially affects women. Divorce had a substantial negative effect on the equivalised household incomes of women, with Australian women experiencing a fall in income of 21 per cent compared to their pre-divorce income.[1] Anne Hollonds, Psychologist and Director of the Institute of Family Studies said, 'When a relationship breaks down, we often don't know how to start sorting out our finances. The new checklist from ASIC's MoneySmart can help you work out what you need to do. You can also use it to support someone you know who's going through a divorce or separation.' ASIC's promotion of the resources is supported by a video featuring Anne Hollonds who explains how the divorce and separation financial checklist can help navigate finances when a relationship ends.

The Federal Court in Melbourne has today made orders winding up Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd and eight other companies associated with the Ostrava financial services business and its proprietors Mr Bradley Grimm and Ms Vanessa Ash. The Court has also ordered that Mr Grimm and Ms Ash be restrained from providing financial services, for 20 and 10 years respectively, and disqualified from managing corporations, for 15 and 7 years respectively. Following a successful application by ASIC, Ms Leanne Chesser and Mr Craig Shepard of KordaMentha were appointed as joint and several liquidators of Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd, Ostrava Asset Management Pty Ltd, Ostrava Securities Pty Ltd, Ostrava Wealth Management Pty Ltd, Beta Pharmacology Pty Ltd, Prometheus Capital Pty Ltd, Thrive Lending Pty Ltd, Trade BTC Pty Ltd and Equity Capital Partners Hedge Fund Pty Ltd (the Companies). Justice Davies made the winding up orders on just and equitable grounds, having regard to serious misconduct and mismanagement of the Companies' affairs, including multiple breaches of financial services laws by the Companies and by Mr Grimm in his capacity as financial adviser to self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) clients. The Court found that Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd and Mr Grimm engaged in dishonest conduct by charging unauthorised fees to clients. The Court also found that the company and Mr Grimm contravened the Corporations Act by making misleading statements to clients about the value of their SMSFs, providing unlicensed managed discretionary account services, failing to comply with financial services disclosure obligations and failing to act in clients' best interests. The Court found that both Mr Grimm and Ms Ash, who is a lawyer and former employee of ASIC, had breached their duties as company directors. Justice Davies found that Mr Grimm's conduct was "deliberate and in contumelious disregard of the law and statutory requirements".  Her Honour said that Mr Grimm had "engaged in deliberate courses of conduct to enrich himself and the corporate group that he established at others' expense". Justice Davies further found that Ms Ash "either knew, or ought to have known, the standard of conduct required by law but she appears to have relied passively on Mr Grimm in the carrying on of the financial services business without proper supervision or exercising any independent or critical judgment".  ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, "This outcome sends a message that anyone who breaches financial services laws or their duties as company directors faces serious consequences. ASIC will not tolerate this kind of egregious misconduct." Background ASIC commenced legal action in April 2015 (refer: 15-106MR) against Mr Grimm, Ms Ash and Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd, Ostrava Asset Management Pty Ltd and Ostrava Securities Pty Ltd. On 24 August 2015 ASIC was given leave to join Ostrava Wealth Management Pty Ltd, Beta Pharmacology Pty Ltd, Prometheus Capital Pty Ltd, Thrive Lending Pty Ltd and Trade BTC Pty Ltd as defendants to the proceeding. On ASIC's application, the Court appointed Ms Chesser and Mr Shepard as provisional liquidators to these and the other corporate defendants on 20 October 2015 (refer: 15-308MR). On 1 April 2016, ASIC was given leave to join Equity Capital Partners Hedge Fund Pty Ltd as a defendant to the proceeding. Ms Ash was the sole director of Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd and a joint director of Ostrava Asset Management Pty Ltd and Ostrava Securities Pty Ltd.  Ms Ash was previously employed by ASIC as a lawyer between 2000 and 2009. Mr Grimm was a director of Ostrava Wealth Management Pty Ltd, a joint director of Ostrava Asset Management Pty Ltd and former director of Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd. He was the sole director of Beta Pharmacology Pty Ltd, Prometheus Capital Pty Ltd, Thrive Lending Pty Ltd, Trade BTC Pty Ltd and Equity Capital Partners Hedge Fund Pty Ltd. Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd and Mr Grimm were until 21 October 2015 authorised representatives of Australian financial services licensee Marigold Falconer International Ltd.  Mr Grimm and Ms Ash are also authorised representatives of Ostrava Securities Pty Ltd which holds its own Australian financial services licence. Mr Grimm and Ms Ash agreed to the winding up, restraint and disqualification orders at a hearing on 21 June 2016.  A copy of Justice Davies' judgment delivered on 1 September 2016 is attached here.

Media Release Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Markets Number 2016-21 Date 1 September 2016 In April 2016, the Reserve Bank conducted a survey of activity in foreign exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives markets in Australia. This was part of a global survey of 52 countries, coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986. Globally, the Australian dollar remains the fifth most traded currency, although its share of turnover decreased by 1½ percentage points to around 7 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the fourth most traded currency pair, having also accounted for a slightly decreased share of global turnover. Activity in Australia's foreign exchange market has moderated since the previous survey in April 2013. Total turnover fell by around 25 per cent, compared with a 5 per cent decrease in global turnover over the same period. Nonetheless, the Australian foreign exchange market remains the eighth largest in the world. Activity in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets declined markedly over the three-year period, primarily reflecting a decline in turnover of forward rate agreements. The preliminary results of the global turnover survey and links to other participating jurisdictions' results are available from the BIS website. More detailed results for the Australian market are available on the 2016 BIS Triennial Survey Results – Australia page. The BIS will also publish global data on outstanding OTC derivatives as at June 2016 in November. The Reserve Bank will publish Australian data on outstanding OTC derivatives at that time.

ASIC notes the decision by ASX-listed Hillgrove Resources Limited (Hillgrove) to record an impairment charge of $67.1 million for its Kanmantoo copper mine and write down $19.2 million of deferred tax assets in its results for the half-year ended 30 June 2016. ASIC made inquiries of Hillgrove in relation to its impairment testing of mine assets and the recoverability of deferred tax assets for the year ended 31 December 2015. Our impairment inquiries concerned the lack of observable inputs used to estimate fair value, failing to include the costs of disposal, and not using current balance date forecasts for the copper price. In its financial report for the half-year ended 30 June 2016, Hillgrove has adopted value in use for impairment testing of mine assets, which does not include cash flow forecasts after the first 5 years that were previously included in the fair value model, and used current balance date forecasts for the copper price. These changes, along with the continued drop in the copper price forecasts have led to the additional impairment charge. As outlined in ASIC media release 16-174MR ASIC calls on directors to apply realism and clarity to financial reports, impairment testing and asset values remain a focus area of our financial reporting surveillances. ASIC reminds companies and those involved in preparing and approving financial reports that commodity price forecasts should be up to date if used as key inputs for impairment testing and that estimates of the fair value of mining assets be supportable with reference to sufficient market-based evidence.

The former CEO of collapsed debenture issuer, Wickham Securities Ltd, was yesterday sentenced to five years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to various charges brought by ASIC, including fraud. Garth Peter Robertson, 50, of Parrearra on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland pleaded guilty on 15 July 2016 to: In the Brisbane District Court yesterday, Mr Robertson was sentenced to a total of five years' imprisonment in respect of the 11 fraud offences, to be suspended after 20 months for a period of five years. Mr Robertson was also sentenced to a total of 18 months' imprisonment for the offences relating to the false information given to Sandhurst and the falsification of Wickham's books. That sentence is to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of the fraud offences. The Court heard that between 15 December 2010 and 27 November 2012, Mr Robertson dishonestly obtained a total of $761,504 from Wickham, which he used for his personal benefit, including for a house deposit, holiday, car, credit card and mortgage repayments and the payment of taxation debts. On ten occasions, Mr Robertson, who was authorised to transact on Wickham's bank accounts, dishonestly directed payments of between $9,300 and $217,500 to his personal bank accounts. They were disguised as legitimate transfers in respect of some of Wickham's loan clients and creditors.   A separate count related to $15,000 that Mr Robertson dishonestly obtained from Balmain on 25 November 2010. Mr Robertson purported to provide Wickham's bank account details to Balmain for the transfer of funds but provided his personal account details instead. The Court also heard that between July and November 2012, Mr Robertson gave information to Sandhurst which: On 27 August 2012, Mr Robertson falsified a Wickham bank statement to give the impression that the account balance was approximately $1.6 million when the actual balance was less than $350,000. Mr Robertson gave the altered bank statement to Wickham's accountant which was used to prepare Wickham's financial report for the year ended 30 June 2012. As a result, the financial report overstated Wickham's cash assets by nearly $1.3 million and showed net assets of approximately $900,000 when it actually had liabilities of $386,000. On 30 November 2012, Mr Robertson gave Sandhurst a balance confirmation letter for a Wickham bank account, which he had altered to show a balance of approximately $10.8 million when the actual balance was less than $265,000. In sentencing Mr Robertson, Judge Moynihan said that Mr Robertson took money from Wickham when he knew that the company was in trouble, which ultimately diminished the sum available to creditors of the company. Judge Moynihan said that the victims of Mr Robertson's "fraudulent and deceitful behaviour" had been adversely affected and that there were devastating consequences for those who lost money as a result of Mr Robertson's conduct. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions prosecuted the matter. Brisbane-based Wickham Securities collapsed in December 2012 owing more than $27 million to approximately 300 debenture holders. Grant Sparks and David Leigh of PPB Advisory were appointed as administrators and then liquidators in February 2013. Further details of action taken by ASIC and outcomes can be found on ASIC's dedicated Wickham Securities webpage.   ten counts of dishonestly obtaining property totalling $761,504 from Wickham between December 2010 and November 2012; one count of dishonestly obtaining $15,000 from Balmain NB Corporation Ltd in November 2010; nine counts of giving or permitting the giving of false information about Wickham to its trustee, Sandhurst Trustees Ltd in 2012; and one count of falsifying books relating to the affairs of Wickham in 2012. falsely stated that no debentures had been issued by Wickham; grossly inflated Wickham's cash holdings on eight occasions (on one occasion by $3 million when the actual balance was only $16,000); and contained false information about the status of the loans advanced by Wickham, including that no loans were in arrears when in fact multiple borrowers had defaulted on the loans and no funds would be recovered by Wickham.

The MDP had reasonable grounds to believe that CommSec contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act by reason of contravening: These rules relate to confirmations of transactions which require disclosures in relation to crossings and trading as principal.  A crossing occurs where a market participant acts for both the buyer and the seller in a transaction. Between 1 August 2010 and 13 February 2014, CommSec issued 114,841 confirmations to retail clients whose orders were executed as crossings but which did not contain the required statement that the transactions had involved a crossing, namely: Between 16 May 2011 to 13 February 2014, CommSec issued 50,484 confirmations to retail clients in relation to which CommSec had entered into transactions as principal but which did not contain the required statement that CommSec entered into the transactions as principal and not as agent, namely: The MDP specified a penalty of $400,000 for the alleged contraventions.

Download the infringement notice The compliance with the infringement notice is not an admission of guilt or liability, and CommSec is not taken to have contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act. The MDP had reasonable grounds to believe that CommSec contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act by reason of contravening rule 5.5.2 of the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (ASX Market) 2010. This rule requires a trading participant to maintain the necessary organisational and technical resources to ensure that, among other things, trading messages submitted by the participant do not interfere with the efficiency and integrity of the market. The MDP has reasonable grounds to believe that, between 2 August 2010 to 14 April 2013, CommSec did not have in place adequate organisational and technical procedures or controls that verified the name and address on an issuer sponsored holding matched that of the client who provided the instructions prior to submitting the orders for the sale of the holdings.

On 19 August 2016, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) upheld ASIC's decision to disqualify Mr Salim Mehajer (Mr Mehajer) from managing corporations for three years. 　 The AAT found that, "Mr Mehajer's management of SMPD P/L and SMEC P/L together with his conduct in relation to their business and property, fell far short of what is reasonably expected of a director." 　 In affirming ASIC's decision, the AAT stated that the disqualification was "appropriate to protect the public and to allow Mr Mehajer time to properly acquaint himself with the duties of a director of a company and his obligations to those with whom the company may transact." 　  The AAT also found that Mr Mehajer"adopted a cavalier approach to his management of the companies, which included their responsibility to creditors, and his duties to ensure that the companies met their legal obligations" 　 The AAT highlighted "the need for such a disqualification in the public interest as a means of protecting others from his incompetence."　 ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer welcomed the AAT finding, saying: "ASIC's power to disqualify directors of failed companies is an important preventative measure we use to safeguard the public interest." 　 The AAT decision was subject to a suppression order that expired on 2 September 2016 (being Friday at midnight). Mr Mehajer's period of disqualification will cease on 5 November 2018. 　 On 5 November 2015, ASIC disqualified Mr Mehajer, of Lidcombe NSW, from managing corporations under s.206F of the Corporations Act 2001 for a period of three years. 　 On 9 November 2015, Mr Mehajer appealed ASIC's decision to disqualify him to the AAT. At the same time, Mr Mehajer successfully sought a stay of ASIC's decision as well as orders suppressing publication of his disqualification and AAT appeal.       　 The disqualification follows an ASIC investigation into the failures of SM Property Development Pty Ltd ACN 130 968 811 (SMPD) and SM Engineering and Constructions Pty Ltd ACN 132 853 153 (SMEC) after receiving reports from liquidators of both companies.  SMPD and SMEC operated in the property development and construction industries.　 ASIC found Mr Mehajer's inability to manage corporations to the standard expected of him caused SMPD and SMEC to fail.  Specifically, ASIC found that: 　 ASIC also found Mr Mehajer's conduct lacked commercial morality in that he allowed SMPD to collect GST of $315,192 from the sale of townhouses but failed to remit it to the ATO. 　   Mr Mehajer failed to ensure SMPD maintained adequate financial records, hindering the liquidator from making enquiries to determine whether payments made by SMPD to third parties were for a proper purpose,　 SMPD and SMEC failed owing $886,701 and $159,206, respectively to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO),　 Mr Mehajer failed to ensure SMPD complied with its statutory obligation to lodge returns with the ATO, and Mr Mehajer provided information to the liquidator of SMPD only after ASIC took criminal proceedings against him.   　   Background

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) is refunding $28.8 million to 376,570 retail accounts, and 17,230 business accounts, after it failed to clearly disclose when certain periodical payment fees would apply.　 Periodical payments are automatic 'set and forget' fixed-amount payments put in place by the customer. They are an alternative to direct debit arrangements, and allow customers to establish a regular payment to another account (for example, to make fortnightly rental payments). Banks may charge a fee for this service, depending on the terms and conditions for the account.  　 In ANZ's case, the account terms and conditions stated that a periodical payment was a transaction to 'another person or business.' This meant that transactions made by the customer to another account in the customer's own name, whether with ANZ or another financial institution, were not covered by ANZ's own definition of a periodical payment and could not be charged the fees that could otherwise apply to periodical payments. 　 ANZ discovered that it was charging fees on payments made between accounts held in the customer's own name, contrary to its definition of a 'periodical payment'. ANZ subsequently reported the matter to ASIC as a significant breach of its financial services obligations. ASIC acknowledges the cooperative approach taken by ANZ in its handling of this matter, and its appropriate reporting of the matter to ASIC.　 As a result, ANZ will refund fees that were charged to customers for payments into another account in the customer's own name.  These fees include: 　 The total amount being refunded includes approximately $25.8 million of fees, with an additional $3 million in interest. 　 ANZ has subsequently changed its terms and conditions to clarify instances where fees for periodical payments apply to an ANZ deposit account.　 ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'Good fee disclosure is integral to ensuring that consumers are in an informed position about how best to manage the cost of their banking.' 　 ANZ has commenced contacting affected customers to explain the impact and the reimbursement and expects to complete the remediation process by the end of September 2016.  　 Customers with queries or concerns about this matter should contact ANZ on 13 13 14 (for retail customers) and 1800 801 485 (for business customers).   non-payment fees charged on personal and commercial accounts when the payment did not proceed because of insufficient funds held in the ANZ deposit account; and payment fees charged on commercial accoumts when a payment is processed from the ANZ deposit account.

Date 6 September 2016 At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent. The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Several advanced economies have recorded improved conditions over the past year, but conditions have become more difficult for a number of emerging market economies. Actions by Chinese policymakers have been supporting growth, but the underlying pace of China's growth appears to be moderating. Commodity prices are above recent lows, but this follows very substantial declines over the past couple of years. Australia's terms of trade remain much lower than they had been in recent years. Financial markets have continued to function effectively. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative. In Australia, recent data suggest that overall growth is continuing, despite a very large decline in business investment, helped by growth in other areas of domestic demand and exports. Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed, but suggest continued expansion in employment in the near term. Inflation remains quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time. Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 is helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this. Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. The best available information suggests that dwelling prices overall have risen moderately over the past year and growth in lending for housing purposes has slowed. Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Collaroy director, Mark Frederic Byers, has been banned by ASIC from managing companies for the maximum of five years for his conduct in the management of four failed companies.  Mr Byer's ban follows the appointment of liquidators to four fashion apparel companies he managed: Mentmore Pty Ltd, 095 987 214 Pty Limited (formerly known as Bleach Pty Limited), 135 580 013 Pty Limited (formerly known as Ksubi Copyright Pty Ltd) and 140 672 797 Pty Limited (formerly known as Ksubi Pty Limited). As a result of information contained in reports provided by the liquidators of the failed companies, ASIC was concerned Mr Byers had failed to prevent insolvent trading by two of the companies and failed to ensure they paid their taxes, failed to discharge his duties as a director and had engaged in illegal 'phoenix activity' – an activity which involves transferring the assets of an indebted company into a new company, while leaving the initial company with insufficient assets to pay creditors. ASIC Commissioner, Greg Tanzer, said 'ASIC will ensure that directors who are involved in illegal phoenix activity and fail to appropriately discharge their duties will be removed from the management of companies'. Mr Byers has the right to seek a review of ASIC's decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Section 206F of the Corporations Act allows ASIC to disqualify a person from managing corporations for up to five years if, within a seven year period, the person was an officer of two or more companies, and those companies were wound up and a liquidator provides a report to ASIC about the company’s inability to pay its debts.

In particular, ASIC was concerned that ING Bank promoted Living Super, between March 2015 and September 2016, as having 'No Fees' for the 'Cash Investment Option', 'No Investment and Administration fees' for the 'Balanced Option' and having low fees options without making it clear that customers were paid a lower interest rate on the cash portion invested with ING Bank than the rate paid by ING Bank to its Saving Maximiser customers for the relevant investment options. Some of the promotions also did not indicate the "no fees or low fees" features may not continue should ING Bank no longer be the investment manager. ASIC discussed its concerns with ING Bank that some members of Living Super may have been misled into believing they would receive the same returns on cash investments held with ING bank as ING Direct banking customers with the Savings Maximiser product. ING Bank has acknowledged that its communication could have been clearer and is writing to all members of Living Super to inform them that the interest rates paid on Living Super may be different to the rates paid to direct banking customers and further, that the fees for Living Super may change should ING Bank no longer be the investment manager. ING Bank have advised ASIC they will also write to affected members informing them of the compensation paid and will not retain any of the financial benefit from the lower interest rate that was applied. ING Bank has told ASIC that it will no longer be promoting Living Super based on No Fees or No Investment and Administration Fee. It has made changes to its internal policies and procedures to help ensure that similar potentially misleading promotions are not undertaken. ASIC also expressed disappointment that ING Bank was promoting Living Super using product inducements to clients separate from the superannuation product such as cash payments. ASIC observes that promotions of this type are a bad practice that may encourage decisions to be made on the basis of short term considerations that may not reflect the needs of a member. ING Bank has advised ASIC that it will stop offering separate product inducements in relation to Living Super. ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, 'This action reflects ASIC's ongoing focus on the disclosure of fees and costs in superannuation. 'Consumers need to be able to make informed decisions about their superannuation and managed investments, based on accurate and consistent fees and costs disclosure. 'Promotion of superannuation products based on low or no fees can be very influential on consumers. This makes it very important to ensure any such promotion is not potentially misleading by reducing the benefits consumers receive in exchange for the no fees or low fees features', Mr Tanzer said. Affected members will not have to do anything to be paid this compensation. Living Super members with queries or concerns about this matter should contact ING Bank on 1800 063 965. ASIC acknowledges the cooperative approach taken by ING Bank and Diversa Trustees Limited (the trustee of Living Super) in relation to the matter. ASIC's concerns were identified as part of its continued focus on fees and costs disclosure (refer: 15-350MR ASIC updates guidance for fee and cost disclosure requirements for superannuation and managed investment products).

Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac) has recently refunded approximately $20 million to around 820,000 customers for not clearly disclosing the types of credit card transactions that attract foreign transaction fees.  Following a customer complaint, Westpac notified ASIC that customers may have been incorrectly charged foreign transaction fees for Australian dollar transactions processed by overseas merchants. Because Westpac's terms and conditions did not clearly state that foreign transaction fees would be charged for such Australian dollar transactions, Westpac commenced a process to identify impacted customers and provide refunds with interest. Westpac has updated its disclosure to clarify that Australian dollar transactions – when they are processed by overseas merchants – will also attract a foreign transaction fee. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'It is essential for consumers to know when fees will be charged, so that they can make an informed decision when using financial products and services.' 　 ASIC acknowledges the cooperative approach taken by Westpac in its handling of this matter, and its appropriate reporting of the matter to ASIC. ASIC is also issuing a warning to consumers about unanticipated credit card foreign transaction fees.  It may come as a surprise to consumers that transactions made in Australian dollars with overseas merchants, or processed by a business outside Australia, can attract a foreign transaction fee. This may even occur where the merchant’s website has an Australian address (domain name) or where a foreign business advertises and invoices prices in Australian dollars. 'It may not always be clear to the consumer that the merchant or entity is located outside Australia, particularly in an online environment where the website uses an Australian domain name,' said ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell. 'We urge consumers to check whether the transaction they make is with an overseas-based merchant or processed outside Australia, especially when they shop online. 'Equally, credit card issuers need to ensure that the disclosure of such fees is clear so customers understand the fees that they are charged when using their cards.' 'Not all cards impose foreign transaction fees. For consumers who make frequent overseas purchases, it is worth shopping around for a card that offers no foreign transaction fees,' he said. ASIC is working with other industry participants on this issue, including by requiring improved disclosure by a number of credit card issuers. Overseas merchants who display prices to Australian consumers in Australian dollars will usually give consumers the choice to pay in the applicable foreign currency or in the Australian dollar equivalent, as converted by the merchant at their own exchange rate (using a process known as 'dynamic currency conversion'). As consumers may be unable to avoid paying international transaction fees for Australian dollar transactions with overseas merchants, consumers may wish to pay in the applicable foreign currency if they expect the exchange rate to be applied by their card issuer to be more competitive than the exchange rate used by the merchant. Customers with queries or concerns about the charging of credit card foreign transaction fees should contact their credit card issuer. ASIC has published specific information and guidance for consumers about the charging of international transaction fees by credit card issuers on its MoneySmart website. A foreign transaction fee (also known as an international transaction fee) is a fee charged by many credit card providers for transactions - including purchases and cash advances: A foreign transaction fee is generally calculated as a percentage of the Australian dollar value of the transaction (typically up to 3.5%). Credit card schemes (such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express) have different rules about foreign transaction fees and the percentage fees will vary depending on the card scheme.  Debit cards may also attract a foreign transaction fee, and consumers are encouraged to check the terms and conditions to find out whether this fee will be imposed by debit card issuers. From March 2014, Westpac's credit card terms and conditions did not clearly state that a 'foreign transaction fee' would be charged for transactions: This may have led customers to believe that a foreign transaction fee would be charged only when a transaction was made in a foreign currency that required a conversion into Australian dollars at the time of the transaction. Affected customers have been provided compensation, including:     　   that are converted from a foreign currency to the Australian dollar; or that are made in Australian dollars with merchants and financial institutions located overseas; or that are made in Australian dollars (or other currencies) that are processed outside Australia. for 'card-not-present' transactions in Australian dollars with merchants located overseas; in Australian dollars with  financial institutions located overseas; or in Australian dollars (or any other currency) that is processed by an entity outside Australia (together referred to as Overseas Transactions in Australian Dollars). a refund of the foreign transaction fee charged on the transaction; where any credit card interest was charged on the foreign transaction fee amount, a refund of the interest component; and an additional interest payment on the refund amount from the date the foreign transaction fee was charged until the date of refund.

ASIC has cancelled the Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence of Brisbane-based education and training business, The Sharemarket College Pty Ltd (AFS licence No 331635). ASIC has also banned the Responsible Managers of The Sharemarket College, Mr Graeme Allan Rogers and Mrs Jill Rogers. The Sharemarket College failed to comply with a number of its obligations as a financial services licensee, including: Mr Graeme Rogers was banned from providing financial services for a period of four years. Mrs Jill Rogers was banned from providing financial services for a period of three years. Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, 'All AFS licensees need to ensure their culture does not drive poor conduct within their business.  ASIC will take action against licensees and individuals who fail to comply with their obligations.'  The Sharemarket College has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC’s decision. The Sharemarket College is a Registered Training Organisation that also held an AFS licence, offering training programs on trading in the share market, intraday markets and exchange traded options markets. Responding to concerns about The Sharemarket College, ASIC shadow-shopped this business posing as potential investors. During that surveillance The Sharemarket College told ASIC staff about its own success when trading on the share market and referred to a real investment portfolio it operated with a capitalisation of $100,000. It was claimed this portfolio was achieving returns of 60 per cent per annum and that results like this could be achieved by enrolling in The Sharemarket College training courses. An ASIC investigation established there was no investment portfolio and that the claims were false and misleading. The investigation also found that The Sharemarket College had made similar claims about the investment portfolio and the returns achieved to members of the public. The AFS licence cancellation and the banning of Graeme and Jill Rogers took effect on30 August 2016. Any consumers who have paid for ongoing financial services from The Sharemarket College should seek legal advice about their options.

ASIC has reviewed the sale of add-on general insurance policies through car dealers and found that the market is failing consumers. Our report released today (REP 492) finds that consumers are being sold expensive, poor value products; products that provide consumers very little to no benefit; and a sales environment with pressure selling, very high commissions and conflicts of interest. These products are sold to consumers when they purchase a new or used car, and cover risks relating to the car itself or relating to the loan that the consumer takes out to purchase the car. Examples include consumer credit insurance and tyre and rim insurance. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'There are serious problems in this market that need to be immediately and comprehensively addressed by insurers.' 'ASIC will be undertaking further work, including potential enforcement action, to ensure that this market delivers acceptable outcomes for consumers. We will also be looking at how insurers can refund consumers who have been sold inappropriate products,' said Mr Kell. For the three year period that we reviewed, we found that: Today's report follows ASIC's release of two reports in February this year about the sale of add-on life insurance by car dealers. ASIC stressed the need for insurers to address the high costs, poor value and poor claim outcomes of life insurance products sold this way. ASIC is putting general insurers on notice that they need to improve consumer outcomes by making substantial changes to the pricing, design and sale of add-on insurance products or face additional regulatory action. The key commitments we are seeking from insurers are: Insurers have notified ASIC that they intend to implement a 20 per cent cap on commissions, which is a positive step. Insurers in this market will be also providing ASIC with data on prices, premiums and claims on a regular basis so that it can monitor the impact of changes on consumers. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'While we welcome the initial steps taken by the insurers to improve the value of these products for consumers, there is still a long way to go. If industry does not deliver swift improvements for consumers, ASIC will take further action, including enforcement action where appropriate.' ASIC's review of these products is ongoing. ASIC will continue to work with insurers and consumer representatives to ensure that proposals for change deliver significantly improved value to consumers. ASIC reviewed seven general insurers, estimated to make up over 90 per cent of the car dealer add-on insurance market, and obtained detailed data about the way these products operate. The seven insurers are: ASIC reviewed five add-on insurance products which are commonly sold by car dealers: This report follows two other reports about add-on insurance released in February this year - REP 471 The sale of life insurance through car dealers: Taking consumers for a ride and REP 470 Buying add-on insurance in car yards: Why it can be hard to say no. As a result of ASIC's work in this area to date, all insurers have changed the pricing of consumer credit insurance so that small business customers are no longer charged more than personal use consumers for the same product. For consumers who are buying a car, ASIC's MoneySmart website contains useful and unbiased information. Consumers can also download the MoneySmart Cars app, which helps consumers understand the true cost of car ownership and what to look out for. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell will be available for comment at 11:00am today at the ASIC offices (Level 5, 100 Market Street Sydney 2000). Please arrive 5-10 minutes beforehand.　 Contact media.unit@asic.gov.au for further information.   Consumers obtained little financial benefit from buying add-on insurance, with consumers paying $1.6 billion in premiums and receiving only $144 million in successful insurance claims - representing a very low claims payout of nine per cent. For some major add-on products, the benefit to consumers was even lower, with consumer credit insurance claims payouts representing just five cents for each dollar of premium.  Car dealers earned $602 million in commissions - over four times more than consumers received in claims, with commissions paid to car dealers as high as 79 per cent. Payment for these insurance products is commonly packaged into the consumer's car loan as a single upfront premium. This can substantially increase the cost of the product by increasing the loan amount and interest paid. Research shows that consumers are often unaware that they even have the policy when it is paid upfront as a single premium, and they may not get a premium refund if they repay their car loan early. Policies have been sold where it is impossible for the consumer to receive a claim payout that is greater than the cost of the insurance. The car sales environment inhibits good decision making about these products because of the conflicts of interest and pressure sales built into the distribution model. The consumer is focussed on purchasing a car and financing that purchase - not on the details of the complex insurance policy. A significant reduction in the amount of commissions paid to anyone who sells an add-on insurance product through car dealers. A significant improvement in the value offered by these products, through substantial reductions in price and better product design and cover. A move away from single upfront premiums that are financed through the loan contract, given the adverse financial impact this has on consumers. Providing refunds to consumers who have been sold policies in circumstances that were unfair, such as where a policy has been sold to a consumer who was never eligible to claim under the policy.

On 22 August 2016, a jury in the County Court of Victoria in Melbourne found that Mr Paul Gerard Choiselat was unfit to stand trial based on the criteria set out in the Crimes (Mental Impairment and Unfitness To Be Tried) Act 1997. Mr Choiselat was due to stand trial on charges of market manipulation and disclosing false information offences (See MR13-327). Having found there was a prima facie case against Mr Choiselat, Judge Carmody made an order under the Crimes Act 1914 to release Mr Choiselat on the condition that he resign effective immediately from all statutory offices of companies registered or operating in Australia and that he not take up or apply for any such position with a company registered or operating in Australia for a period of 3 years.

 Number 2015-14 Date 28 August 2015 Embargo For Immediate Release Payments System Issues – Payments Council MoU, EFTPOS Access Regime and Review of Card Payments Regulation Memorandum of Understanding between the Payments System Board and the Australian Payments Council The Payments System Board (the Board) and the Australian Payments Council (the Council) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), setting out a framework for engagement between the two bodies. The MoU was signed in conjunction with the first meeting between the two parties on 21 August. The Council was created to enhance industry coordination in dealing with the cooperative issues that arise in the payments system and to represent the industry directly in discussions with the Board. The Council held its inaugural meeting in late 2014 and has recently been consulting on an Australian Payments Plan, seeking views on desirable characteristics for the Australian payments system, long-term trends and systemic challenges. Revocation of the EFTPOS Access Regime and the 2004 EFTPOS Designation Following a decision of the Board, the Reserve Bank has revoked the Access Regime applying to the EFTPOS system in Australia, along with the 2004 designation of the EFTPOS system. The Access Regime was introduced in September 2006 to improve competition and efficiency in the EFTPOS system, which at that time consisted of a series of bilateral connections and business arrangements between participants. With the establishment of a central hub by eftpos Payments Australia Limited (ePAL), the Board judged that suitable access arrangements were now in place such that the Access Regime could be removed. This revocation also enabled the Bank to revoke the designation of the EFTPOS system that was gazetted in September 2004, as the Access Regime was the only remaining instrument to rely on this designation. The June 2012 designation of the system governed by ePAL remains in effect. Review of Card Payments Regulation The Board also discussed its ongoing review of card payments regulation at its 21 August meeting. It has asked the Bank staff to liaise with industry participants on the possible designation of certain card systems (including the bank-issued American Express companion card system, the Debit MasterCard system and the eftpos, MasterCard and Visa prepaid card systems). The Bank has the power under the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 to designate a payment system if it considers that doing so is in the public interest. The decision to designate a system is the first of a number of steps the Bank must take to exercise any of its powers, such as imposing an access regime on a system or setting standards for the safety and efficiency of that system.

Westpac also discovered that there were 28,369 customers under the age of 18 who were eligible for a St. George Complete Freedom Student transaction account (which has no monthly service fee), but instead held a standard St. George transaction account which charged a monthly fee. Westpac reported this matter to ASIC under its breach reporting obligations in the Corporations Act. ASIC acknowledges the cooperative approach taken by Westpac in resolving this matter. Westpac has now provided refunds to affected customers. The refund payments included an additional amount reflecting interest. In addition to compensating customers, Westpac is enhancing the account opening process for these Westpac and St. George products to ensure all new eligible customers receive the relevant fee waivers. This includes automated application of the relevant fee waivers based on the customer's date of birth submitted during the application process. Westpac also monitors this activity to ensure the correct treatment of eligible accounts. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, ‘Financial institutions that offer products with benefits such as fee waivers must have effective and robust systems in place to deliver the promised benefits to consumers.'

NEO is based in Perth, Western Australia with approximately 160 individual and corporate authorised representatives. The EU follows an ASIC surveillance of Neo's’s business. ASIC's surveillance focussed on Neo’s general obligations as an Australian financial services (AFS) licensee and included a review of its compliance and risk management framework including its programs, policies, procedures and controls. ASIC’s surveillance also tested financial product advice provided to retail clients and the internal advice audits and remediation reviews conducted by Neo. ASIC's advice concerns included failing to address important client objectives, not making reasonable enquiries to determine all relevant client circumstances and not fully considering the consequences when replacing existing financial products.

The County Court of Victoria has convicted and sentenced Mr Barry Patrick to 6 years and 3 months imprisonment, after he pleaded guilty to six charges following an ASIC investigation.  Mr Patrick, 73, of Sunbury, Victoria, will be eligible for parole after serving 3 years and 9 months. Mr Patrick pleaded guilty to: Mr Patrick nominated investors to be directors of a number of companies formed to purchase properties on the outskirts of Melbourne for development. Those companies were Wrestway Property Development Pty Ltd, Exclusive Property Consultants Pty Ltd, Compendium Holdings Pty Ltd and Integrated Consolidated Holdings Pty Ltd. To obtain funds for the property development projects, Mr Patrick persuaded investors to refinance their homes and/or establish self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF) and then invest their superannuation in the developments. Between 2007 and 2010, Mr Patrick illegally obtained more than $600,000 from 14 retail investors to fund the property developments because of financial advice provided by him when he was not authorised to do so.  The funds raised by Mr Patrick were not used to develop the properties but were instead used to pay interest payments to past and existing investors and to meet repayments on loans, as well as his own personal use such as artwork and jewellery. In sentencing Mr Patrick, His Honour Judge Gavan Meredith noted that Mr. Patrick had shown little remorse for leaving his victims lives in ruin and that the offending was protracted, calculated and at times brazen. Commissioner Peter Kell welcomed the County Court sentencing. "The conduct of Mr Patrick exposed vulnerable members of the community to severe financial loss and hardship.

Australia's home loans industry has improved its performance over the past year, adopting better 'responsible lending' practices, an ASIC review has found, though there is still  room for improvement. 　 ASIC has released its report (REP 493)'Review of interest-only home loans: Mortgage brokers’ inquiries into consumers’ requirements and objectives' on the responsible lending practices of 11 large mortgage brokers with a particular focus on how they inquire into and record consumers' requirements and objectives. It also examined how the changes implemented by lenders in response to the findings from ASIC’s report into interest-only home loans from 12 months ago last year (refer: Report 445) have flowed through to mortgage brokers.　 Since the release of Report 445 in August 2015,  　 Information provided by the mortgage brokers showed that for the six months from July 2015 to December 2015,    　 Almost 80% of applications reviewed included a statement summarising how the interest-only feature specifically met the consumer's requirements and objectives. This compared favourably with Report 445's finding that more than 30% of applications reviewed showed no evidence the lender had considered whether the interest-only loan met the consumer's requirements.　 'It is vital that mortgage brokers understand consumers' requirements and objectives to ensure they are not placed in unsuitable credit contracts,' said ASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell. 'ASIC is pleased that our concerns about interest-only loans and responsible lending are being acted on by the home lending industry, but there is still room for improvement.' 　 ASIC identified practices that place brokers at increased risk of non-compliance with their responsible lending obligations, and identified opportunities for brokers to improve their practices. Key compliance risks identified included:  　 The report details steps that mortgage brokers should take to improve their current practices, including: 　 The review of mortgage brokers' practices follows on from ASIC's previous work on interest-only loans, which reviewed how lenders were meeting their responsible lending obligations when providing interest-only home loans (Report 445) . 　 The National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (National Credit Act) requires mortgage brokers to make reasonable inquiries about the consumer’s requirements and objectives in relation to the loan and make an assessment of the as to the suitability of the loan they assist the consumer  in obtaining. 　 Report 445 found that a greater proportion of interest-only home loans were arranged through the mortgage broker channel than direct channels (lenders). More than 50% of consumers use the services of mortgage brokers to assist in securing credit more generally.　 Mortgage brokers are well placed to assist consumers find products that meet their requirements. For these benefits to be realised, it is important that consumers have confidence in mortgage brokers, including their compliance with the National Credit Act.　 ASIC is currently undertaking a separate review at the request of the Government in relation to broker remuneration structures and their effect on consumer outcomes. That report will be provided to the Government by the end of 2016.   the percentage of new home loans approved by lenders which are interest-only has decreased by 12%; and　 the amount that can be borrowed by an individual consumer through an interest-only home loan has decreased, as lenders have adjusted their assessment of consumers' ability to repay, in line with ASIC's recommendation in Report 445. 　 the number of new interest-only home loans fell by 16.3%, with total value of these loans reducing by 15.6%; and　 the percentage of interest-only loans with a term greater than five years reduced by more than half, from 11.2% to 5.1%.　 Policies and procedures—Mortgage broker policies and procedures provided only general information, rather than tailored information on specific products and loan features that may impose increased financial obligations or restrict repayment flexibility (such as interest-only home loans); 　 Recording of inquiries—Record keeping was inconsistent and in some cases records were fragmented and incomplete; 　 Explaining the loan choice—More than 20% of applications reviewed did not include a statement explaining how the interest-only feature of the loan specifically met the consumer’s underlying requirements and objectives. The level of detail in these statements varied considerably and in some cases, where an interest-only loan was specifically sought by a consumer (including where this option was recommended by a third party, such as an accountant), the reason for this was not clear; 　 Consumer understanding of risks and costs—In some cases, where the potential benefit of the interest-only loan depended on the consumer taking specific action (for example, allocating additional funds to higher interest debt), it was unclear whether the consumer understood the potential risks/additional costs if the specific action was not taken. 　 Ensuring they understand the consumer's underlying objectives for requesting specific loan products and features;　 Recording concise summaries of consumers' requirements and objectives and the reason why a particular product, features and lender was chosen;　 Providing a statement summarising the broker's understanding of the consumer's requirements and objectives, which could also include the reason a particular loan is suggested, for the consumer to confirm before obtaining a loan.　 Where the potential benefits of a loan feature might require the consumer to undertake specific behaviour, ensuring consumers were aware of the action they needed to take to obtain the potential benefit, as well as the potential costs should this action not be taken.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has paid four infringement notices totalling $180,000 in relation to breaches of responsible lending laws when providing personal overdraft facilities. CBA reported this matter to ASIC following an ASIC surveillance. CBA conducted an internal review which identified a programming error in the automated serviceability calculator used to assess certain applications for personal overdrafts.  As a result of the error, between July 2011 and September 2015, CBA failed to take into consideration the declared housing and living expenses of some consumers. Instead, CBA's serviceability calculator substituted $0 housing expenses, and living expenses based on a benchmark which in some instances was substantially less than the living expenses declared by the consumer. As a result, this led to an over-estimation of the consumer's capacity to service the overdraft facility. CBA informed ASIC that between July 2011 and September 2015, as a result of the error, CBA approved: Some consumers were approved for a personal overdraft, or an increased limit on their personal overdraft, even though their declared expenses were greater than their declared income. ASIC was concerned that this conduct breached responsible lending laws and that affected consumers would have been unable to comply, or could only comply with substantial hardship, with their obligation to repay their personal overdraft on demand. CBA has informed ASIC that it will write off a total of approximately $2.5 million in personal overdraft balances. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'Credit licensees should continuously monitor their internal processes to ensure compliance with the law. This is especially the case with automated decision-making systems where ongoing monitoring is needed to ensure that information is correctly inputted into systems.' The responsible lending obligations that prohibit lenders from entering into credit contracts which are unsuitable for the consumer are found in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth). The laws aim to ensure that credit contracts are not unsuitable for consumers (see s133(1)), and consumers are likely able to afford the credit contract (see s133(2)). ASIC issued four infringement notices in August 2016 totalling $180,000 for the breaches outlined above.  CBA self-reported the breaches to ASIC, and has co-operated with ASIC's investigation. The payment of an infringement notice is not an admission of guilt in respect of the alleged contravention. ASIC can issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has committed particular contraventions of the National Credit Act.   9,577 consumers for overdrafts which would have otherwise been declined; and 1,152 consumers for higher overdraft limits than would have otherwise been provided.

ASIC has permanently banned former Allianz financial adviser Kerrie Marie King from providing any financial services and engaging in any credit activities. In April 2016, Ms King was convicted in the County Court of Victoria on five counts of obtaining property by deception, two counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception, and other unrelated charges. Between 2008 and 2011, Ms King stole funds from clients and forged loan documents in the names of these clients. She also provided false documentation relating to a loan application on her own behalf. The total value of the deceptions amounted to more than $1.3 million. Ms King was sentenced to a five-year term of imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years. ASIC has the power to permanently ban a person from operating in the financial services and credit industry without a hearing if the person is convicted of a 'serious fraud', such as obtaining property or financial advantage by deception. ASIC has permanently banned Ms King so as to protect the public and because it is in the public interest. The banning is effective as from 12 August 2016. ASIC Commissioner Peter Kell said, 'It is imperative that consumers of financial services and credit products can rely on the honesty and integrity of persons who provide such services. As this case shows, conduct that breaches financial services or credit laws will result in action by ASIC to remove them from these industries.'

ASIC has permanently banned Mr Rommel Panganiban, of Bella Vista, New South Wales, from providing financial services after an ASIC surveillance found that he failed to act in his clients' best interests or have a reasonable basis for advice, and that he had prioritised his own interests over that of his clients. Mr Panganiban was an authorised representative of AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd between 19 March 2010 and 12 September 2014.   Between 4 February 2011 and 31 July 2014, Mr Panganiban advised 49 clients who held risk insurance through their AMP superannuation fund to cease their existing AMP insurance policies and replace them with new AMP insurance policies. He did this without considering whether this was in the best interests of his clients and without advising his clients that he was able to simply transfer the insurance policies. By ceasing and replacing the insurance policies, rather than transferring them, the full rate of commission became payable to AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd.  Mr Panganiban's remuneration was positively influenced by the upfront commissions he generated as a result of his advice. As a result of replacing rather than transferring the clients' policies, Mr Panganiban's clients were exposed to unnecessary consequences including gaps in cover and changes in definitions and policy terms and they risked policy exclusions and loadings. It also unnecessarily restarted the non-disclosure period that allows insurers to avoid policies within the first three years of inception inadvertent non-disclosure. The repetitive nature of Mr Panganiban's conduct, against the best interests of his clients and motivated by greed, led to a finding by ASIC that Mr Panganiban was not of good fame and character. AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd alerted ASIC to Mr Panganiban's behaviour on 3 October 2014, and has written to his clients offering to review their advice. Mr Panganiban was a representative of Lionsgate Financial Group Pty Ltd from 29 September 2014 until 3 August 2016. ASIC will require both AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd and Lionsgate Financial Group Pty Ltd to notify Mr Panganiban's clients of his banning. Mr Panganiban has appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for a review of ASIC's decision. After the ASIC Delegate conducted the hearing of this matter pursuant to the Hearing Notice, Mr Panganiban filed an application in the Federal Court seeking orders that ASIC provide him with additional material (namely, client files) and that ASIC be restrained from making a decision in relation to the Hearing Notice. In his application, Mr Panganiban claimed that by failing to provide him with the client files, ASIC had denied him procedural fairness. Mr Panganiban's application was heard on 21 April 2016. On 13 May 2016, his Honour Justice Bromwich delivered his judgment, in which he dismissed the application and awarded costs to ASIC. In his judgment, his Honour Justice Bromwich confirmed that it is for ASIC to determine the matters and material on which it proposes to rely in making a banning decision, and that it is those matters and material which the rules of natural justice require to be disclosed to the banning candidate (refer: 16-160MR) On 9 September 2016, an application in the AAT by Mr Panganiban for a stay of the ASIC Delegate's decision and confidentiality orders was dismissed. Mr Panganiban's appeal to the AAT for review of ASIC's decision will be heard on a date to be fixed. This outcome is a result of ASIC's Wealth Management Project. The Wealth Management Project was established in October 2014 with the objective of lifting standards by major financial advice providers. The Wealth Management Project focuses on the conduct of the largest financial advice firms (NAB, Westpac, CBA, ANZ, AMP and Macquarie).

ASIC has released guidance on review and remediation conducted by Australian financial services (AFS) licensees providing personal advice to retail clients. This follows Consultation Paper 247 Client review and remediation programs and update to record-keeping requirements (CP 247), issued in December 2015 (refer: 15-388MR). The guidance reflects work done with industry over the past several years where ASIC has worked with advice licensees with large remediation programs to shape the scope and nature of remediation arising from systemic advice issues. The key principles set out in the guidance are: 'ASIC wants to ensure that advice licensees proactively address any systemic problems caused by their conduct and, where necessary, put processes in place to remediate their clients for loss suffered in a way that is timely, fair and transparent,' ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said. 'Advice firms that take effective and timely steps to fix problems if something goes wrong will be much better placed to retain the trust and confidence of their clients,' said Mr Kell In the 2015-16 financial year, ASIC secured over $200 million in compensation and remediation for financial consumers and investors across the areas it regulates. While the guidance is directed at licensees who provide personal advice to retail clients, review and remediation takes place in many other sectors of the financial services industry. The principles set out in the guidance should be applied to other review and remediation where relevant. ASIC will shortly release an amendment to Class Order [CO 14/923] Record-keeping obligations for Australian financial services licensees when giving personal advice together with a report summarising the key feedback ASIC received in response to CP 247, and our response to that feedback. ASIC announced on 6 May 2015 that it would develop regulatory guidance on advice licensees conducting review and remediation (refer: 15-101MR). On 16 December 2015, ASIC released CP 247 seeking feedback on proposed guidance on review and remediation conducted by AFS licensees that provide personal advice. The consultation paper also sought feedback on clarification to the record-keeping requirements for AFS licensees relating to the best interests duty. Submissions received were generally supportive of ASIC issuing guidance on review and remediation. Submissions were also generally supportive of ASIC’s proposed amendments to the AFS licensee record-keeping requirements when providing personal advice.   review and remediation is likely to be appropriate where a systemic issue has occurred that may have caused loss or detriment to clients the scope of review and remediation should ensure it covers the right advisers, the right clients and the right timeframe the process of review and remediation should be comprehensive, timely, fair, and transparent. There should be clearly defined principles to guide the process and an appropriate governance structure effective, timely and targeted communication is key to ensuring that clients understand the review and remediation and how it will affect them; and clients should have access to an EDR scheme if they are not satisfied with the remediation decision made.

ASIC has permanently banned Mr Steven William Hill from engaging in credit activities and providing financial services. An ASIC investigation found that between January 2006 and February 2007, Mr Hill, through Hill Stephens & Associates Pty Ltd and International Finance Consortium (Aust) Pty Ltd induced various investors to pay approximately $618,000 to acquire interests in a 'house and land' property development located in Queensland. Mr Hill was found guilty of fraudulently misappropriating $281,000 of the invested funds, which were directed to company bank accounts to make payments to Mr Hill and other third parties. On 18 April 2016, His Honour Acting Judge Garling sentenced Mr Hill to 2 years and 9 months jail for fraudulent misappropriation (refer: 16-118MR). Following the sentencing, ASIC determined that Mr Hill should be permanently banned as he was convicted of offences involving dishonest and fraudulent conduct. ASIC Commissioner Peter Kell said Mr Hill's misconduct was very serious. 'ASIC will ban people from the finance industry who act dishonestly and place personal interests ahead of those they service.  Mr Hill's actions exposed vulnerable members of the community to financial loss and hardship', Mr Kell said. Mr Hill has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of ASIC’s decisions. ASIC investigations revealed that between January 2006 and February 2007, Mr Hill met with various investors based in New South Wales.  Describing himself as a 'financier/consultant', Mr Hill, through his company Hill Stephens & Associates Pty Ltd, told investors he would be able to provide them with investment opportunities to build their wealth towards retirement. Mr Hill advised investors their funds would be used as 'seed capital' in a number of Queensland based property developments he was facilitating. Mr Hill advised investors that they would receive returns of between 10 - 30% per annum, however, unknown to the investors, funds paid were not invested in the property developments as originally advised by Mr Hill. In June 2013 Mr Hill was charged with eight counts of fraudulent misappropriation (refer: 13-146MR). In March 2015 Mr Hill was ordered to stand trial on seven counts of fraudulent misappropriation (refer: 15-050MR). In March 2016 Mr Hill was convicted on 6 counts of fraudulent misappropriation by a Sydney District Court jury after a four-week trial. (refer: 16-072MR).

ASIC has banned Mr Geoffrey Woodcock of Auckland, New Zealand, from providing financial services for a period of four years. Between November 2011 and October 2013, Mr Woodcock was the founder and manager of Capital Alternatives Pty Ltd and a director of Velvet Assets Pty Ltd. Both of those companies promoted alternative investments in Australia. However, Capital Alternatives, Velvet Assets and Mr Woodcock were not holders of Australian financial services (AFS) licences. They were also not authorised representatives of a licensee. Following an investigation, ASIC found: Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, 'The Australian financial services licensing regime provides safeguards. Consumers should not invest with a person or entity in Australia unless they are authorised by, or hold, an AFS licence.' Mr Woodcock has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for a review of ASIC's decision.   a number of the alternative investments promoted by Capital Alternatives and Velvet Assets were financial products and as such the companies were required to hold an AFS licence; as a consequence, Capital Alternatives and Velvet Assets carried on a financial services business without holding an AFS licence and so contravened s911A of the Corporations Act; Mr Woodcock was involved in this contravention by the companies; and Mr Woodcock personally induced clients to invest by failing to disclose that around 40-45 per cent of the money invested would be retained by him as commission.

 Number 2015-15 Date 1 September 2015 Embargo For Immediate Release Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.0 per cent. The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace, with some further softening in conditions in China and east Asia of late, but stronger US growth. Key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago, in part reflecting increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling. The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate over the period ahead, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Equity markets have been considerably more volatile of late, associated with developments in China, though other financial markets have been relatively stable. Long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low. Overall, global financial conditions remain very accommodative. In Australia, most of the available information suggests that moderate expansion in the economy continues. While growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages for some time, it has been accompanied with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year. Overall, the economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet, with domestic inflationary pressures contained. Inflation is thus forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate. In such circumstances, monetary policy needs to be accommodative. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates, while equity prices have moved lower and been more volatile recently, in parallel with developments in global markets. The Australian dollar is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices. The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Further information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board's ongoing assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.

ASIC has cancelled the Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence of Melbourne-based company Allegianz Pty Ltd (Allegianz) for failing to lodge financial statements and auditor reports. 　 Allegianz's AFS licence was suspended by ASIC for six months in March 2016 for failing to meet its obligations to lodge financial statements and auditor reports.  The financial statements and auditor report were not lodged during the suspension period, and ASIC cancelled Allegianz's AFS licence on 7 September 2016. 　 The annual lodgment of financial statements and auditor reports is an important part of a licensee demonstrating it has adequate financial resources to provide the services covered by its licence and to conduct the business in compliance with the Corporations Act 2001. 　 In cancelling its AFS licence, ASIC found that Allegianz had failed to lodge financial statements, auditor reports and auditor opinions over consecutive years. This was in breach of both its legal obligations and licence conditions, and came despite repeated requests from ASIC to comply.　 Allegianz had held its AFS licence since July 2012 and provided specialised government, commercial and financial advisory services.  　 Allegianz's failure to comply with its basic obligations during its suspension period resulted in the cancellation of its licence, and comes as part of ASIC's ongoing efforts to improve reporting and lodging standards across the financial services industry. 　 ASIC Deputy Chair Peter Kell said, ‘Licensees are required to lodge financial statements and auditor reports with ASIC to demonstrate their capacity to provide financial services. Failure to comply with reporting obligations can be an indicator of a poor compliance culture. ASIC won't hesitate to act against licensees who do not meet these important requirements.'

ASIC has warned firms and issuers involved in initial public offerings (IPOs) in Australia to ensure their marketing campaigns comply with the letter and spirit of the law, particularly when using emerging social-media strategies. An ASIC review of marketing practices in IPOs has found that so-called 'traditional' means of communication - telephone calls, emails and websites - remain more important for the marketing of an offer to retail investors. The review found that the use of social media is not yet pervasive; it is only used occasionally by small to medium-sized firms to market IPOs. REP 494 Marketing practices in initial public offerings of securities details the review's findings, highlights areas of concern and provides for consideration ASIC's recommendations to improve marketing practices for IPOs in the future. Between October 2015 and March 2016 ASIC reviewed the online and social media marketing of 23 IPOs where a prospectus was lodged.  ASIC then conducted a more extensive review of the marketing practices and materials of 17 firms that were involved in 7 of the original IPOs.  ASIC also monitored the marketing of other IPOs as part of its usual prospectus review work.  Key findings of the report included:   ASIC Commissioner John Price said the purpose of the review was to understand current market practices and identify areas of particular concern. 'The way that an IPO is marketed may unduly influence the decision to invest in an IPO,' he said. 'We are living in more innovative times where we are seeing new interactive methods of communication and marketing used in many corporate and commercial arenas, including taking a company public. While we embrace such innovation, we also want to remind firms and issuers to ensure that their marketing practices comply with the advertising and publicity restrictions in the Corporations Act,' he said. ASIC regularly reviews prospectuses and may monitor the advertising and publicity that takes place during the IPO to ensure compliance with Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act.  In addition to our usual work in monitoring fundraisings, we also plan to carry out further work this financial year focusing on investor decision making.    There were some oversight weaknesses in relation to marketing done via telephone calls and social media, and in ensuring that marketing material is kept up to date. The use of forecasts in communications or the targeting of investors from a particular background means special care may need to be taken to avoid misleading investors. Firms and issuers did not always properly control access to information about the offer to ensure retail investors base their decision on the prospectus; and Some good practices were adopted by firms to ensure that communication was consistent with the prospectus information.

Mr Darren Wayne Thompson, 39, has today pleaded not guilty in the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney to 11 separate charges of procuring insider trading. The charges were brought after an ASIC investigation. Mr Thompson was formerly employed by Credit Suisse Management Australia as a vice president in its investment banking department. ASIC alleges that on 11 separate occasions between 25 May 2008 and 3 June 2011, Mr Thompson procured a close friend, Mr Michael William Hull, to purchase the shares of 7 Australian listed companies while in possession of inside information about those companies that he had acquired as a result of his employment. Mr Hull's profits from those trades (realised and unrealised) totalled approximately $492,000. The matter was adjourned and will return to Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on 15th November 2016. On 3 June 2016, Mr Hull was sentenced to 17 months imprisonment after pleading guilty to insider trading charges brought by ASIC and prosecuted by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (see: 16-179MR). Mr Hull's insider trading was identified by ASIC’s market surveillance team and referred to ASIC’s markets enforcement team for investigation and enforcement action. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is prosecuting the matter. Background The maximum penalties associated with the alleged offences, subject to the date(s) on which they were committed, are either five years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000, or 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $495,000.

ASIC issued the infringement notice as it considered it has reasonable grounds to believe Sanhe breached its continuous disclosure obligations by failing to inform the Sydney Stock Exchange that it was likely that its operating financial result for the full year to 31 December 2015 would be materially lower than the operating result of the previous corresponding period. 'All companies looking to list on Australian markets must be aware of and comply with their disclosure obligations', ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour said.

On 9 September 2016, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) upheld ASIC's decision to disqualify Mr Abe Samuel from being an approved self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) auditor. 　 The AAT found that Mr Samuel "plainly breached the auditor independence requirements in APES 110 (Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants). As a consequence, he contravened his professional obligations under s128F of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993." The AAT was satisfied that Mr Samuel "failed to carry out or perform adequately and properly the duties of an auditor under the Act or the Regulations or as otherwise required by law; and, furthermore or alternatively, the Applicant (Mr Samuel) is not a fit and proper person to be an approved SMSF auditor for the purposes of the Act." The AAT stated that it upheld ASIC's decision due to "the very serious and fundamental nature of the applicant’s (Mr Samuel's) deficiencies; his longstanding and ongoing failure to understand properly those deficiencies; and the clear need to uphold the integrity of the SMSF system." ASIC Commissioner John Price noted the AAT finding, saying: "To safeguard the SMSF sector, ASIC will continue to use its power to disqualify approved SMSF auditors that don’t perform their role adequately and meet professional standards." SMSF trustees and members can check whether their auditor is registered, or whether a person has been disqualified, by searching ASIC's SMSF auditor register at connectonline.asic.gov.au. Information about Mr Samuel was referred to ASIC by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). On 7 October 2015, ASIC made an order disqualifying Mr Samuel from being an approved SMSF auditor. Mr Samuel requested that ASIC reconsider the disqualification decision. On 23 November 2015, a delegate of ASIC confirmed the decision. ASIC found that Mr Samuel had breached auditor independence requirements of APES 110 where he was: On 18 December 2015, Mr Samuel applied to the AAT for a review of the disqualification decision. From 1 July 2013, the SIS Act required all auditors of SMSFs to be registered with ASIC. This was to ensure that all SMSF auditors at least meet the base standards of competency and expertise. ASIC and the ATO work closely together as co-regulators of SMSF auditors. The ATO monitors SMSF auditor conduct and may refer matters to ASIC for possible action such as disqualification or suspension of their registration.

ASIC has discontinued its proceedings against Simon Tickner and Lisa Darcy, former directors of LM Investment Management Ltd (LMIM).  In 2014, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia seeking financial penalties and banning orders following the collapse of the Gold Coast-based fund manager against founder Peter Charles Drake and former directors Francene Maree Mulder, Eghard van der Hoven, Simon Jeremy Tickner and Lisa Maree Darcy (See 14-308MR) The claims against Mr Tickner and Ms Darcy focused on their conduct as directors in signing off a loan to Maddison Estate Pty Ltd, which Mr Drake owned and controlled, in 2011. Proceedings against the other directors focused on both the 2011 transaction and another transaction that occurred in 2012. The trial commenced on 29 August 2016. On 12 September 2016, after the close of its case, ASIC discontinued its claim against all directors in relation to the 2011 transaction.    The proceeding related to the 2012 transaction continues against Mr Drake, Ms Mulder and Mr van der Hoven and has been adjourned until 23 September 2016 for closing submissions.

ASIC has permanently banned Mr Sandeep Madhoji from providing financial services or  engaging in credit activity after he was sentenced to imprisonment for fraud charges. This prosecution was the result of a joint operation between the Queensland Police Service and ASIC.  The charges stemmed from conduct that occurred between 2 September 2010 and 11 July 2012. During this period, Mr Madhoji misused clients' funds by applying some client's funds to cover the loss made on other client portfolios. As a result of Mr Madhoji's actions, 14 clients collectively lost $3,251,281. These losses were incurred by Mr Madhoji using his recommended trading strategy. Mr Madhoji made false statements to his licence holder Redwood Capital Group and to his clients to conceal his losses. He acted outside his authority by making multiple unauthorised transfers and withdrawals from the accounts to hide the losses. Mr Madhoji also falsified client account statements in relation to the relevant transactions. Mr Madhoji committed these offences to enhance his reputation to clients and create an illusion that he was a highly successful trader. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'Dishonesty by any financial advisor will not be tolerated by ASIC. We will investigate and prosecute instances of dishonesty to ensure that consumers have confidence in the financial system.' On 26 August 2016, Mr Madhoji was sentenced to 7.5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 22 months in the Brisbane District court on 55 charges of fraud under sections 408C of the Queensland Criminal Code.   Mr Madhoji was an Authorised Representative under Redwood Capital Group Pty Ltd, AFSL No. 289327. AFSL No. 289327 held by Redwood Capital Pty Ltd was cancelled on 9 April 2013. Mr Madhoji's status as an Authorised Representative was ceased on 1 July 2012. This matter was prosecuted by the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions.     Background

ASIC has banned Adelaide financial adviser Michael Mahoney from providing financial services for a period of four years. Mr Mahoney was employed by the BT Financial Group Pty Ltd (BTFG) in the Westpac Scaled Advice Insurance business from October 2013 to July 2014 to provide general advice only to retail clients on insurance products. ASIC's investigation found that during the period Mr Mahoney was employed at BTFG, he engaged in conduct that was misleading and deceptive. Specifically, he entered false information regarding various clients' health or health-risk factors in telephone applications for insurance policies issued by Westpac Life Insurance Services Ltd (WLIS). This resulted in WLIS issuing policies to clients based on false information and assuming greater risks without having an opportunity to undertake an assessment of those risks. WLIS has agreed to honour the affected client policies. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'This outcome shows that ASIC expects employees who are providing financial services to maintain high standards and not engage in conduct that is misleading and deceptive.' Mr Mahoney has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC's decision. This outcome is a result of ASIC's Wealth Management Project. The Wealth Management Project was established in October 2014 with the objective of lifting standards by major financial advice providers. The Wealth Management Project focuses on the conduct of the largest financial advice firms (NAB, Westpac, CBA, ANZ, AMP and Macquarie). ASIC's work in the Wealth Management Project covers a number of areas including: As part of its Wealth Management Project, ASIC has banned the following advisers from the financial services industry, in addition to Mr Mahoney:   Damian O'Rourke (refer: 16-318MR) Rommel Panganiban (16-309MR) Anthony Jason Sourris (16-270MR) Sarah Kate Gardner (16-269MR) Nicholas Kerr (16-260MR) Craig Scott Miller (16-239MR) Wayne Meadth (16-188MR) Hardik Bhimani (refer: 16-124MR) Gerard McCormack (refer: 16-059MR) Shane Thompson (refer:16-022MR) Ben Rickman (refer:16-006MR) Ben Cheung (refer: 16-004MR) Mark Tidbury (refer: 15-383MR) Amanda Ritchie (refer: 15-294MR) Stuart Murray Jamieson (refer:15-288MR) Sharnie Kent (refer: 15-286MR) Alfie Chong (refer: 15-259MR) Martin Hodgetts (refer: 15-218MR) Shawn Hickman (refer: 15-213MR) Brett O'Malley (refer: 15-121MR) Brian Farber (refer: 15-178MR), and Rebecca Locksley (refer: 15-070MR).

LT Management Pty Limited (LT Management) has paid a $10,800 infringement notice penalty after making potentially misleading statements about the cost of setting up a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) using the services of RS Capital Partners Pty Limited (RS Capital), trading as My SMSF Property. ASIC’s concerns related to representations made by LT Management on the website www.silverhall.com.au (Silverhall) between August 2015 and March 2016. The representations were that establishing a SMSF was free, when conditions applied to the 'free' set-up that were not clearly disclosed on the website. The conditions for 'free' SMSF set-up included buying a property directly through Silverhall and using the accounting services of RS Capital for 24 months at a cost of $2200. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, ‘Accuracy in advertising is integral to maintaining consumer trust and confidence in the SMSF sector. Such conditions should be clearly stated so that consumers can make an informed decision. ASIC will continue to take action where we see advertising that might mislead consumers.' ASIC acknowledges LT Management immediately took steps to correct its advertising and is developing improved processes for updates to the content of the Silverhall website. The payment of an infringement notice is not an admission of a contravention of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 consumer protection provisions. ASIC can issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has contravened certain consumer protection laws. Background RS Capital paid an infringement notice penalty after it also made potentially misleading statements on the My SMSF Property website about the cost of setting up an SMSF using RS Capital's services (refer: 16-266MR)

As part of its ongoing work to curb illegal phoenix activity, ASIC has completed a proactive surveillance program that monitored the integrity of the payment systems in the Australian building and construction industry. The surveillance program, carried out during the 2014/15 financial year, targeted eight large commercial construction projects across New South Wales, Victoria and Qld. ASIC checked the payment processes and systems of 40 individual building and construction companies (contractors) working on those projects. The campaign identified concerns about the conduct of some companies within the building and construction sector, which may be falsifying statutory declarations when claiming payment from principal contractors for work undertaken.  The focus of ASIC’s surveillance centred on: (a) principal contractors requiring contractors to provide statutory declarations to confirm that the contractors have paid all amounts owing to employees and secondary contractors, before principal contractors pay invoice issued by the contractor; and (b) contractors signing statutory declarations and providing it to principal contractors, in circumstances where it appears that contractors may not have paid all secondary subcontractors at the date of swearing the statutory declarations.     As a result of surveillance campaign, ASIC found that two contractors may have provided principal contractors statutory declarations that falsely claimed that secondary contractors had been paid at the time of signing the statutory declarations.  ASIC also found that once the contractors had received payment from the head contractors, they subsequently paid all secondary contractors the amounts owing.  Both contractors were issued warning letters about their conduct and advised to review their internal compliance systems and processes.  ASIC has also identified a further two matters, outside of this surveillance program, where contractors have been engaged by a number of local councils and who have allegedly provided false statutory declarations where it appears that subcontractors had not been paid at the date that the statutory declarations were signed.  ASIC is investigating that matter.  ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, 'While this conduct may benefit contractors by improving their cash flow, the flow-on effect is likely to cause significant detriment to other operators in the supply chain, such as other businesses engaged to work on these projects, in particular secondary contractors. Secondary contractors are often small business operators engaged by contractors to complete building works.  The viability of their businesses is often dependant on being paid by contractors in a timely manner.  They usually are not in a position to carry cash flow risk imposed upon them by contractors.  'This practice by contractors, in addition to being an offence, can cause secondary subcontractors to suffer cash flow problems and experience financial distress, placing them at risk of insolvency', Mr Tanzer added.  ASIC encourages anyone who has suffered loss as a result of these practices to report their concerns to us on 1300 300 630 or to lodge a report of misconduct online.  Background The surveillance program was undertaken following feedback received from small business, industry bodies and other government agencies about the endemic use of false statutory declarations in the building and construction industry (refer: 14-212MR). The falsification of statutory declarations to obtain payment from a head contractor could be an indicator that contractors are experiencing cash flow problems and may be in financial distress. This may subsequently give rise to illegal phoenix activity. While false statutory declarations and fraud matters are matters for other regulatory and enforcement agencies, company officers who knowingly make a false statement regarding payments to creditors may find themselves facing criminal or civil action by ASIC. Under the Corporations Act, ASIC can also take administrative action against company officers who engage in misconduct.

Following an application made by ASIC on 19 August 2016, the Federal Court of Australia has made orders limiting the ability of Aviation 3030 Pty Ltd (Aviation) to deal with the proceeds of sale of property it owns in Victoria. The Aviation property was purchased in 2011 by Aviation, which raised funds for this purpose from around 70 shareholders and unitholders. Aviation consented to the orders being made. ASIC commenced its investigation into Aviation in May 2016. In the course of its investigation, ASIC became aware that:  Based on these matters, ASIC was concerned that the proceeds of sale of the Aviation property would be distributed in accordance with the 2016 share issue. This was in circumstances where investors had not been provided with proper disclosure in relation to the dilution of their interests, either at the time of their investments or subsequently.    ASIC obtained the orders to protect the interests of investors and specifically to enable them to be provided with: As part of an agreement reached with ASIC, Aviation undertook to provide disclosure to the Investors in relation to these matters, in a form agreed to by ASIC. Aviation has advised ASIC that it has completed this process. Aviation has advised ASIC that the offer to purchase the Aviation property has been withdrawn. The Orders will remain in place until further order of the Federal Court. The matter returns to the Federal Court on 25 November 2016. ASIC's investigation into Aviation is ongoing.   in March 2016, Aviation had issued shares to companies associated with a director and a former director of Aviation, purportedly pursuant to an Aviation letter dated 4 May 2011 and an option agreement dated 18 September 2012 entered into by the then directors of Aviation ('the 2016 share issue');  this resulted in a substantial dilution of the interests of investors, and an increase in the interests controlled by the directors of Aviation and their associates;  neither the 4 May 2011 letter nor the 18 September 2012 option agreement had been disclosed to investors prior to their investments in Aviation and the 2016 share issue had also not been disclosed to all investors; and   in May 2016, Aviation received an offer from a third party to purchase the Aviation property for more than $100 million and that this offer had not been disclosed to all investors. ASIC's understanding was that this property was expected to be sold within a short timeframe. information as to the 2016 share issue (and the documents purportedly relied upon by Aviation for that purpose); details of the proposed sale of the Aviation property; and an opportunity to decide whether to obtain independent advice concerning their investments.    Developments subsequent to the orders

Former financial adviser, Gabriel Nakhl, appeared in the Local Court of New South Wales today on 19 charges brought by ASIC of engaging in dishonest conduct with investor funds. ASIC alleges that Mr Nakhl, of Illawong, NSW knowingly engaged in dishonest conduct in relation to twelve investors by: The alleged conduct occurred between March 2009 and March 2011 while Mr Nakhl was an authorised representative of Australian Financial Services Limited (in liquidation) and from about March 2011 to about September 2013 while he was the sole director of SydFA Pty Ltd (in liquidation). The charges were brought against Mr Nakhl following an ASIC investigation. Mr Nakhl did not enter a plea but asked for an adjournment to obtain legal advice. The matter was stood over until 11 October 2016. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is prosecuting the matter. Mr Nakhl has been charged with 19 counts under section 1041G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). In February 2013, ASIC obtained court orders against Mr Nakhl preventing him from disposing of, dealing with or otherwise diminishing certain assets. See 13-023MR for more details. In September 2013, Mr Nakhl became a bankrupt and placed SydFA Pty Ltd into liquidation. In November 2013, ASIC accepted an enforceable undertaking from Mr Nakhl that permanently restricts him from providing financial services and restricts him from managing a corporation for 15 years.

ASIC has extended for two years seven class orders giving relief to foreign financial service providers (FFSPs) providing financial services to wholesale clients. These class orders were due to expire (‘sunset’) between 1 October 2016 and 1 April 2017. At the same time, ASIC has released Consultation Paper 268 Licensing relief for foreign financial services providers with limited connection to Australia (CP 268). CP 268 outlines a proposal to repeal a related class order for foreign entities with a limited connection to Australia providing services to wholesale clients. This class order is due to sunset on 1 April 2017. ASIC has extended for two years its relief from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services (AFS) licence when providing financial services to Australian wholesale clients: see ASIC Corporations (Repeal and Transitional) Instrument 2016/396. We have extended this relief for two years so that we can comprehensively review and consult on the policy settings underlying our relief for FFSPs. This extension and review comes as a result of market and regulatory developments since the relief was first granted and a number of ongoing international and domestic reviews. CP 268 outlines further the rationale for this review. ASIC Corporations (Repeal and Transitional) Instrument 2016/396 continues ASIC's previous relief for FFSPs in the same form with an amended information gathering power. This amendment clarifies that ASIC may request information from an FFSP about the operation of its financial services business. ASIC will consult publicly before 1 October 2018 on its relief in this area.                            ASIC proposes to repeal [CO 03/824] Licensing relief for financial services providers with limited connection to Australia dealing with wholesale clients ([CO 03/824]). ASIC is seeking feedback on whether the relief provided by the class order is no longer necessary in light of other provisions introduced to the Corporations Act 2001 since [CO 03/824] was made. If there is any residual need for licensing relief ASIC would consider these on a case by case basis. Submissions on CP 268 are due by 2 December 2016. Our FFSP relief was previously provided by: Under the Legislation Act 2003, all class orders are repealed automatically or 'sunset' after a period of time (mostly 10 years) unless we take action to preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant. All government organisations are responsible for considering whether the legislative instruments they have made that are due to sunset will be relevant after their sunset date.

ASIC has issued a revised policy and regulatory framework for charities that raise investment funds. The framework removes regulatory barriers to the issue of financial products while strengthening protection for public investors. The changes follow an ASIC review of the operation of exemptions available to charities from certain managed investment, debenture, fundraising and licensing provisions of the Corporations Act. The changes are aimed at ensuring the policy is consistent with our objectives of confident and informed investors and fair and efficient markets. The review had identified difficulties in liquidity management by fundraisers and the effectiveness of their disclosure. Following extensive consultation under Consultation Paper 207 Charitable investment fundraisers (CP 207) and further consultation with industry stakeholders on our proposals, ASIC has made a number of updates, including: The changes have been made in consultation with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to ensure there are no inappropriate inconsistences in our policy position. ASIC notes that some charitable investment fundraisers are Religious Charitable Development Funds which rely on APRA's exemption from the Banking Act (which is also under review by APRA). In addition, we have applied disclosure, lodgement, breach reporting and financial reporting requirements although these requirements are less stringent than the equivalent provisions in the Corporations Act that apply to regulated entities. The changes announced today are effected by repealing existing class order CO 02/184 Charitable investment schemes- fundraising and replacing it with ASIC Corporations (Charitable Investment Fundraising) Instrument 2016/813 and issuing a new version of Regulatory Guide 87: Charitable investment fundraising and school enrolment deposits. The existing class order CO 02/151 School enrolment deposits has also been repealed and replaced with ASIC Corporations (School Enrolment Deposits) Instrument 2016/812 without substantive amendment. This will continue to permit schools accepting enrolment deposits to do so without the requirement to comply with the relevant provisions of the Corporations Act. ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer said, 'We are satisfied that our policy strikes the right balance between exempting charitable investment fundraisers from applicable legal provisions where investors are motivated to support the charitable purposes while maintaining appropriate protections for investors.'   from 1 January 2017, charitable investment fundraisers will not be permitted to issue at-call or investments with a term of less than 31 days to retail investors from 1 January 2018, charitable investment fundraisers that wish to issue investments to retail investors who are not associated with the charity will no longer be exempted from the requirement to hold for Australian financial services licence from ASIC. Further, additional restrictions apply that are designed to avoid the investments being used for transactional facilities.

Following public consultation, ASIC has continued the relief available to operators, promoters and developers of strata schemes and management rights schemes from certain managed investment, licensing, hawking and disclosure provisions. ASIC has also continued the relief available to real estate agents who are engaged by investors to let out their strata unit for residential or commercial purposes but not as part of a serviced strata arrangement. The property, strata and management rights schemes class orders have been remade without significant changes so that their ongoing effect will be preserved without any disruption to those who rely on them. ASIC has replaced the following class orders into a single, new, legislative instrument: All seven Class Orders have been combined into a single instrument, ASIC Corporations (Serviced Apartment and Like Schemes) Instrument 2016/869 so that the substantive effect of the relief in each Class Order is continued beyond the expiration date in a new instrument. We are currently updating our guidance in Regulatory Guide 140, Serviced strata schemes (RG 140) to reflect the new instrument. We will release an updated RG 140 in due course. ASIC has also continued the relief available to real estate agents who are engaged by investors to let out their strata unit for residential or commercial purposes but not as part of a serviced strata arrangement. The relief applies as set out in the new legislative instrument ASIC Corporations (Property Rental Schemes) Instrument 2016/870. The new instrument replaces Class Order [CO 02/182] Real property rental schemes.  ASIC remade this instrument without significant changes.  It continues the relief given to real estate agents where their ordinary business in leasing or managing property does not involve a managed investment scheme where, for example, the owner of the property has the day to day control of the property through being able to give directions to their agent.  On 8 February 2016, ASIC released Consultation Paper 250 Remaking class orders on property, strata and management rights schemes (CP 250) which publicly consulted on remaking the class orders dealing with property, strata and management rights schemes as well as the Real Property Rental Schemes class order. In CP 250, ASIC proposed to remake the class orders contained in these Instruments without significant changes. Submissions received were supportive of ASIC's proposal to remake the class orders without significant changes.

ASIC has commenced legal action in the Federal Court of Australia against Huntley Management Limited (Huntley), an Australian financial services licence holder and responsible entity of managed investment schemes. Huntley has admitted to two contraventions of s12DB(1)(e) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act) and the parties have filed a Statement of Agreed Facts. ASIC and Huntley have agreed that Huntley failed to comply with the ASIC Act by making the statement that it 'acts as responsible entity, custodian, trustee and/or manager for over 40 managed investment projects approved by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission' (statement): ASIC and Huntley agreed that the statement was false or misleading because ASIC did not approve the investment projects referred to in the statement; ASIC merely registered these projects, which were managed investment schemes.

ASIC has permanently banned former Deutsche Bank FX options and futures trader, Andrew Donaldson, of Sydney, from providing financial services. The banning follows an ASIC investigation into Mr Donaldson's conduct in 2013 and 2014 in entering a significant number of false entries into Deutsche Bank's records. By making these false entries, Mr Donaldson temporarily offset trading losses he had suffered and artificially increased his reported trading profits. The entries related to trades purported to have been carried out by Mr Donaldson on behalf of Deutsche Bank and resulted in a temporary overstatement of Deutsche Bank's internal Australian Management Accounting revenue result of approximately 28 million Euros. As the entries related to trades that were never executed in the market, no external parties were affected. An ASIC delegate found that Mr Donaldson contravened a financial services law (by engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to a financial product), that his conduct was extremely serious and that ASIC had reason to believe that Mr Donaldson was not of good fame and character. Mr Donaldson's conduct was detected by Deutsche Bank and reported to ASIC. Deutsche Bank conducted an investigation into its relevant processes and controls to identify weaknesses and has notified ASIC of  the measures it believes will better monitor and detect such conduct in the future.   ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour said, 'The integrity of our financial markets is vitally important and ASIC will take action to remove anyone in the financial services industry who engages in conduct that undermines this integrity. 'This action is also a reminder to financial institutions to ensure that they have the right systems, people and processes in place to monitor trading conduct and detect and address trading discrepancies in a timely manner,' she said.  Mr Donaldson has a right to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of ASIC’s banning order. Mr Donaldson was employed in Deutsche Bank's Global Foreign Exchange Business in Sydney between March 2012 and August 2014. Deutsche Bank assisted ASIC in its investigation.     Background

ASIC today released updated regulatory guidance on its relief for Managed Discretionary Accounts (MDAs) in Regulatory Guide 179 Managed Discretionary Accounts (RG 179). On 29 September 2016, ASIC made a new legislative instrument ASIC Corporations (Managed Discretionary Accounts) Instrument 2016/968 to replace its class order on MDAs that was due to expire ('sunset') on 1 October 2016. This instrument continues the relief from the provisions in the Corporations Act that would apply to the provider of a MDA with some changes.  The instrument and RG 179: MDA providers currently offering MDAs under ASIC's regulated platform no-action letter must comply with the new regulatory requirements by 1 October 2018 including the new requirement to obtain an MDA specific dealing by issue licence authorisation. Other existing MDA providers must comply with the revised requirements from 1 October 2017. In Consultation Paper 200: Managed discretionary accounts–Update to RG 179 (CP 200) ASIC proposed to update the financial resource requirements for MDA providers to ensure that these requirements correspond with the requirements that apply to responsible entities of managed investment schemes and for platform operators. ASIC does not intend to proceed with those proposals at this time. It is important that MDA providers maintain adequate financial resources to operate their MDAs effectively and compliantly. ASIC will review these requirements over the next two years after we have further information about the kinds of entities affected, taking into account licence authorisation applications made by those who have been relying on the no-action position for regulated platforms. Under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, all class orders are repealed automatically or 'sunset' after a period of time (mostly 10 years) unless we take action to preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant. Read more about sunsetting class orders An MDA is a facility where client portfolio assets are managed on an individual basis by an MDA provider at the MDA provider's discretion (subject to any agreed limitation).  　 There are a wide variety of arrangements that can constitute an MDA. Industry uses different terminology to refer to products that may have the features of an MDA: for example, products commonly known by industry as a Separately Managed Account, Individually Managed Account or a Unified Managed Account.　 ASIC applies a tailored regulatory regime to MDA providers, exempting them from the managed investments provisions in Chapter 5C, and the product disclosure provisions in Chapter 6D and in Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act.  We do this on the basis that MDA providers have more limited functions than responsible entities of a registered scheme.　 ASIC Class Order [CO 04/194] Managed discretionary accounts has been repealed.   incorporate relief for MDAs operated on a regulated platform and MDAs provided to family members, with some changes from relief under  the previous no-action positions implement new requirements to ensure MDA investors are adequately informed when the MDA provider has a discretion to invest in products where recourse is not limited (for example, contracts for difference) require specific upfront disclosure about: terminating the MDA contract　 fees charged within the MDA, and outsourcing arrangements, where the MDA provider outsources significant functions of the MDA, and terminating the MDA contract　 fees charged within the MDA, and outsourcing arrangements, where the MDA provider outsources significant functions of the MDA, and provide greater certainty on the scope and application of the MDA relief and about ASIC's expectations for managing conflicts of interest.

ASIC has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney against Vocation Limited (in liquidation) (Vocation) and the company's former executive managing director, Mr Mark Hutchinson; former non-executive chairman, Mr John Dawkins; and former company secretary and Chief Financial Officer, Mr Manvinder Gréwal. The proceedings arise out of ASIC's investigation of events leading to Vocation's entry into Deeds of Settlement with the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development on 27 October 2014. ASIC alleges that Vocation made representations in relation to its securities that were misleading; that it failed to notify the ASX of information that it was required to disclose; and that it provided the ASX with a defective cleansing notice relied upon to raise approximately $72.5 million from institutional and sophisticated investors pursuant to a placement in September 2014. Further, ASIC contends that Mr Hutchinson, Mr Dawkins, Mr Gréwal were either involved in the failure of Vocation to meet its obligations or otherwise failed to discharge their duties to Vocation with the requisite degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in their respective positions would exercise.

The Federal Court has found that a Cairns-based lender, Channic Pty Ltd (Channic), broker Cash Brokers Pty Ltd (Cash Brokers) and the sole director of both companies, Mr Colin William Hulbert, breached consumer credit protection laws when they provided loans to vulnerable indigenous consumers for the purchase of second hand cars from Super Cheap Car Sales, which was also owned by Mr Hulbert. The consumers largely lived in the relatively isolated Aboriginal community of Yarrabah, located near Cairns. Cash Brokers assisted these consumers to obtain loans from Channic at 48 per cent interest to enable them to purchase vehicles from SuperCheap.  Cash Brokers also charged brokerage fees of either $550 or $990 to arrange loans with Channic which were also financed under the loans.  Channic did not assess whether the loans were affordable or suited to the consumers' requirements. The Federal Court found that Channic and Cash Brokers breached responsible lending laws under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (National Credit Act) which is legislation that the Court found: …  seeks to ensure that a consumer does not enter into an “unsuitable” credit contract … by casting a statutory obligation on a credit provider not to enter into such a contract coupled with a regime for inquiries and verification about the relevant statutory matters and an assessment protocol.  These normative matters are not simply a “tick the box” compliance exercise.    The Federal Court also found that Channic engaged in unconscionable conduct and that the loan contracts were unjust transactions. In finding the conduct unconscionable the court stated: It must have been obvious … that having regard to the educational qualifications of the consumers, their background, their financial circumstances and their lack of commercial experience, that they would not have comprehended the content, in a meaningful way, of the loan contracts.  The Court also held Mr Hulbert personally liable, stating that: CBPL and Channic were no more than wafer thin transparent membranes between the consumer and Mr Hulbert.  Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said, 'ASIC will take action where vulnerable people are deliberately targeted by lenders who engage in unconscionable conduct. We have a strong focus on lenders and financial services firms who push poor quality and unsuitable financial products to indigenous consumers, particularly where they fail to meet responsible lending obligations.' The matter will be listed for a further hearing, on a date to be set, in relation to the declarations sought by ASIC, civil penalties and consequential orders. The court may impose a penalty of up to $1.1 million against corporations and up to $220,000 against an individual for each contravention of the responsible lending obligations.

The IOP gathers intelligence from Indigenous consumers and their advocates, undertakes surveillance, implements targeted financial literacy programs and works with industry to improve access to appropriate products and services. Other outcomes affecting indigenous consumers coming as a result of work by ASIC and the IOP include:   Home Essentials (14-021MR) Amazing Rentals (15-141MR) Make it Mine (15-349MR)

Date 4 October 2016 At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent. The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Labour market conditions in the advanced economies have improved over the past year, but growth in global industrial production and trade remains subdued. Actions by Chinese policymakers have been supporting growth, but the underlying pace of growth in China has been moderating. Inflation remains below most central banks' targets. Commodity prices have risen over recent months, following the very substantial declines over the past few years. The higher commodity prices have supported a rise in Australia's terms of trade, although they remain much lower than they have been in recent years. Financial markets have continued to function effectively. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative. Government bond yields are near their historical lows. In Australia, the economy is continuing to grow at a moderate rate. The large decline in mining investment is being offset by growth in other areas, including residential construction, public demand and exports. Household consumption has been growing at a reasonable pace, but appears to have slowed a little recently. Measures of household and business sentiment remain above average. Labour market indicators have been somewhat mixed. The unemployment rate has fallen further, although there is considerable variation in employment growth across the country. Part-time employment has been growing strongly, while growth in full-time employment has been subdued. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment in the near term. Inflation remains quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time. Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 has been helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are all assisting the economy to make the necessary economic adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this. Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Growth in lending for housing has slowed over the past year. Turnover in the housing market has declined. The rate of increase in housing prices is lower than it was a year ago, although some markets have strengthened recently. Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Growth in rents is the slowest for some decades. Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

ASIC has remade ten legislative instruments and repealed three that are due to expire ('sunset') in 2016 and 2017, following public consultation. ASIC has remade these instruments before they sunset. The new instruments will continue the substantive effects of the previous instruments with some minor amendments, which include simplifying the drafting to give greater clarity. The following instruments have been remade: However, ASIC has varied the application of the Corporations (Low Volume Financial Markets) Exemption Notice 2003 by increasing the transaction threshold of low volume financial markets and amending the transaction period to which the transaction threshold applies. ASIC has also amended the application of [CO 01/1519] such that it no longer imposes certain conditions on the relief. ASIC has repealed the following class orders, having formed the view that this relief is no longer required: Under the Legislation Act 2003, legislative instruments such as class orders are repealed sunset after 10 years unless action is taken to exempt or preserve them.  This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant.

The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Senator The Hon. Kelly O’Dwyer has today launched ASIC's MoneySmart ‘Simple Money Manager'. The Simple Money Manager is a free online budgeting resource designed to help culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) Australians with everyday budgeting to take control of their finances. ASIC consulted a wide range of government and community organisations to ensure the user experience was at the centre of the design and sought advice on the community languages chosen.  The resource is available in English and has been translated into eight community languages, representing established communities (Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Italian, Arabic, Vietnamese) and recently arrived groups (Somali, Dari and Sudanese Arabic). It includes in-language audio to help users easily interact with it.  Minister O’Dwyer said the Simple Money Manager provides a practical tool to assist with everyday financial management which addresses the limited written literacy for some language groups. ‘Improving the accessibility of financial tools will help people take control of their daily finances and alleviate any stress this brings. It will also build confidence to develop positive money habits which will stay with them for the rest of their lives,' Minister O’Dwyer said. One in eight Australians aged 14 and over access government information and services online, totalling around 324 million transactions a year[1]. More than half of these people experience accessibility issues, including consumers with limited English language capacity unable to interact with webpages available only in English. This supports ASIC's approach to providing in-language resources for CALD consumers to help them make informed financial decisions. 'Budgeting is the best way to get on top of your finances and take control of them. ASIC’s new digital resource is easy to use and will help you work how much money you have coming in and going out. It can be tailored to your unique situation to help you manage your expenses', said Mr Peter Kell, ASIC’s Deputy Chairman. ASIC will share the resource with key stakeholders, including the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia (FECCA) and the Department of Human Services to assist community workers and financial counsellors educate their clients.  FECCA Chairperson Joe Caputo said the Simple Money Manager is an important tool to support the work of intermediaries with CALD communities to improve financial decision making. The new resource will be promoted through our networks, with the communities who will most benefit. 'ASIC’s MoneySmart is to be commended for this innovative new resource. We believe it will help to break down the barriers CALD consumers may face when making financial decisions, which can be amplified by the additional challenge of English not being their primary language,' said Mr Caputo. The Simple Money Manager will be promoted online and on social media. It is available on ASIC’s MoneySmart website. For more financial tips visit moneysmart.gov.au. ASIC is the Australian Government agency responsible for financial literacy, consistent with its strategic priority to promote confidence and trust in the financial system.  Financial literacy is about having the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours to make good financial decisions. It is part of ASIC’s strategic priority to promote consumer trust and confidence in the financial system. ASIC leads and coordinates the National Financial Literacy Strategy, which sets out a national framework for financial literacy work in Australia.  The Strategy highlights the importance of providing people with tailored resources and tools, and of responding to the financial issues facing vulnerable sectors of the community. CALD Australians are identified as one of a number of priority audiences in the National Strategy. ASIC’s MoneySmart website provides impartial and trusted financial guidance and tools to support informed financial decision-making for all Australians, including CALD consumers and intermediaries.

ASIC has been pursuing Australian Financial Services (AFS) licensees that have failed to meet their obligation to lodge their annual financial statements and auditor's reports with ASIC within the specified timeframe. Licensees with a financial year ending 30 June are required to lodge the profit and loss statement and the balance sheet by 31 October of the relevant year. Since November 2015, ASIC has cancelled three AFS advice licences and suspended a further two for failing to lodge annual financial statements and auditor's reports. Deputy Chair Peter Kell said, ‘Licensees are required to lodge financial statements with ASIC to demonstrate their capacity to provide financial services. Failure to comply with reporting obligations can be an indicator of broader compliance concerns.' 'We are disappointed that some licensees have not heeded the message that their failure to lodge audited financial statements may result in the cancellation of their AFS licence. We continue to focus on this obligation and will take further action where licensees do not comply,' Mr Kell said. ASIC has contacted AFS licensees who have not lodged audited financial statements and taken appropriate action if they fail to subsequently lodge these statements. Outcomes and actions stemming from the financial advisers licensee non-lodgment project, for the period November 2015 until September 2016, include:   In February 2016, ASIC suspended Traders4Traders Pty Ltd for three months. ASIC later lifted the three-month AFS licence suspension after the company lodged all of its outstanding financial statements and auditor reports. In March 2016, Allegianz Pty Ltd was suspended for six months. ASIC cancelled their AFS licence in September 2016 after they failed to lodge outstanding financial statements and auditor reports. In May 2016, Winley Insurance Group Pty Ltd's AFS licence was cancelled for failing to lodge financial statements and auditor reports.

Findex Group Limited and Financial Index Australia Pty Ltd (FIA) have each paid a $10,800 penalty following the issuing by ASIC of infringement notices for potentially misleading claims on the Findex website (www.findex.com.au).   The Findex group of companies (which include Findex Group Limited and FIA) promotes itself as one of Australia’s largest financial advisory businesses. The Findex website indicates the business advises 250,000 clients nationally and has $17 billion in funds under advice. In recent years, the Findex Group has grown considerably through the acquisition of smaller financial planning and accounting businesses.  Between August 2015 and December 2015, FIA published several representations on the Findex website referring to services provided by the Findex group as being ‘independent’ and/or ‘non-aligned’.    Statements made on the Findex website giving rise to ASIC's concerns included representations that: ASIC was concerned the use of the word ‘independent’ and ‘non-aligned’ may have led  consumers to believe services being offered by the Findex Group were unaffected by any conflict of interest, such as commissions, when in fact the services offered were likely to have been affected by: ASIC considered that the inaccurate representations of independence by the Findex Group may have prevented consumers from correctly assessing the quality of the services on offer. An infringement notice was issued to Findex Group Limited for making the statements on behalf of the Findex Group.  A separate infringement notice was issued to FIA as the registered owner of the Findex website. Findex Group Limited and FIA responded to ASIC’s concerns by removing the offending statements from the website by December 2015. 'The accurate promotion of financial services, particularly around the issue of independence, is critical in order for consumers to make confident and informed financial decisions.' ASIC Deputy Chair Peter Kell said. 'This action puts the financial services sector on notice that ASIC is serious about tackling the inappropriate use of the term ‘independent’.' The payment of an infringement notice is not an admission of a contravention of the ASIC Act consumer protection provisions. ASIC can issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has contravened certain consumer protection laws.     a corporate member of the Findex group, Financial Index Wealth Accountants Pty Ltd, was one of Australia's leading independent providers of retail financial planning, accounting and wealth management services;  and the Findex group was ‘Australia’s largest independent financial advice company’. commissions or other benefits received from the issuer of recommended financial products; and conflicts of interest arising out of the group’s associations or relationships with issuers of financial products.

ASIC has permanently banned former Hobart financial adviser Troy Andrew Rodney Williams from providing financial services.  Mr Williams, of Sandy Bay, is a director and former financial adviser at Hobart financial planning business, Directions Wealth Management.  Mr Williams was authorised to provide financial advice as a representative of Financial Services Partners Pty Ltd (FSP), a subsidiary of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ).  An ASIC investigation found that in the period from December 2003 to March 2015 Mr Williams acted dishonestly by providing Financial Services Guides to his clients that contained false statements in relation to his qualifications. The guides falsely stated that Mr Williams held a Diploma of Financial Planning  and that he had completed certain courses related to that diploma.  ASIC’s investigation also found that in December 2014, Mr Williams dishonestly created false certificates purportedly evidencing his qualifications and sent them to FSP.  After becoming aware of his actions, FSP suspended his authority to provide financial advice on 10 March 2015. The authority was subsequently cancelled by FSP on 20 April 2015.  Mr Williams has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC's decision.  Background This outcome is a result of ASIC's Wealth Management Project.

In addition, the Court made orders that: In conducting the inquiry and making the orders against Mr McDermott, the Court has confirmed its power to inquire into the conduct of administrators under section 447E of the Corporations Act, in addition to its power to inquire into the conduct of registered liquidators under section 536 of the Corporations Act. The concerns identified by the Court include: The Court considered that, while Mr McDermott’s conduct was not dishonest, he failed to carry out and perform adequately and properly his duties as liquidator, and also his duties and functions as administrator and deed administrator; and that each aspect of his conduct was serious and occurred across multiple appointments. In ordering a three year suspension, the Court took into account: The Court found that, at its lowest, the evidence indicated a systematic failure of systems and procedures, and, at its highest, it indicated a lack of understanding of, and in some instances a disregard for, the duties and responsibilities of a liquidator. ASIC Commissioner John Price said that the Court's decision sent a clear reminder to insolvency practitioners of the importance of remaining strictly independent from referrers, and maintaining high standards of integrity and professionalism whether acting as liquidators, controllers or administrators.  'The failure of registered liquidators to abide by the law and the ARITA Code, in particular in matters of conflict of interest and when drawing remuneration, has the potential to undermine public confidence in registered liquidators and as this case demonstrates, has significant consequences for a liquidator's ability to practise as a liquidator', Mr Price said.   A copy of the Court's decision, which was handed down on 4 October 2016, may be accessed here.  The orders against Mr McDermott follow an application by ASIC in December 2015 to inquire into the conduct of Mr McDermott concerning the performance of his duties as a registered liquidator, voluntary administrator and deed administrator of twenty-six companies to which he had been appointed (refer: 15-394MR). Under the Corporations Act, ASIC may apply to the Court to undertake an inquiry where it appears that an insolvency practitioner has not faithfully performed, or is not faithfully performing, his or her duties as a liquidator or receiver or adhering to relevant legal requirements. After making an inquiry into the conduct of an insolvency practitioner, the Court may make such orders as it sees fit. The companies to which John Stuart Potts has been appointed joint liquidator/administrator are:   Mr McDermott must satisfactorily complete an external review of ten current appointments to be conducted by an independent reviewer engaged by Mr McDermott and approved by ASIC; Mr McDermott must successfully complete the Australian Restructuring Insolvency & Turnaround Association (ARITA) Advanced Certification course before accepting new appointments as a registered liquidator, controller or administrator; Mr McDermott is removed as liquidator of Fontana Property Group Pty Ltd and Total Elevator Services Pty Ltd; a joint liquidator/administrator, John Stuart Potts  is appointed to 15 external administrations to which Mr McDermott has until now been the sole appointee; and Mr McDermott is to pay costs to ASIC. independence concerns arising out of Mr McDermott's relationship with his appointer or referrer; failures to consider and avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest in accepting appointments; failures to lodge with ASIC reports of suspected misconduct by officers or former officers of companies under administration;  failures to properly inform creditors of the basis for remuneration claimed, drawing down that remuneration without properly informed creditor approval or Court approval, and failure to repay remuneration he had drawn down while adequate approvals were obtained. Mr McDermott's acceptance of three appointments when a clear conflict of interest existed; his acceptance of legal advice that he had no conflict when he should have known that the lawyer providing the legal advice was also conflicted; his failure to resign conflicted appointments despite objections from creditors; his failure to acknowledge the existence of the actual conflict in his appointments in affidavits filed in the proceeding; systemic and repeated deficiencies in Mr McDermott's remuneration reports; his drawing of remuneration on the basis of deficient reports, and failure to seek Court approval for (and failure to repay) the funds until almost two years after they were drawn; and Mr McDermott's failure to implement checklists and procedures recommended to him during various training courses and his failure to complete an ongoing practice review conducted by a peer reviewer.

In April 2016, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission commenced an investigation into the life insurance business of The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited, trading as CommInsure. The investigation relates to a range of concerns regarding CommInsure's life insurance business, including its claims handling practices and procedures. The investigation commenced following concerns raised in the media earlier this year. ASIC has undertaken an extensive range of enquiries into the concerns raised. Enquiries are ongoing and no comment on potential outcomes will be made at this time. Given the wide ranging and often complex nature of these matters, ASIC's investigation is anticipated to continue for some time. The investigation remains a priority for ASIC and we will provide public updates where appropriate as the matter progresses. ASIC has worked closely with APRA during the investigation. As part of the investigation so far, ASIC has: ASIC has also released Report 498: Life insurance claims: An industry review today. It identifies a number of areas as potential opportunities for law reform in relation to life insurance. LINK: Download ASIC's report into life insurance claims Separately to ASIC's investigation, CommInsure has commenced a number of independent reviews, including in relation to declined claims,  its life insurance claims handling practices and in relation to ethical concerns raised in the media. ASIC has been engaging closely with CommInsure concerning the scope and findings of these reviews. ASIC will continue to monitor the scope and conduct of these reviews and will continue to liaise closely with APRA during this process. In March 2016, CommInsure announced that it would update the definitions of heart attack and severe rheumatoid arthritis in its trauma products, and reassess past claims under those definitions going back to 11 May 2014. CommInsure advises it has paid benefits for 17 claims, totalling approximately $2.5 million. In the meantime, if consumers have any concerns about a CommInsure life insurance policy or claim, they should contact CommInsure's customer relations team on 1800 106 133 or 13 10 56. Consumers can also take a life insurance claim dispute to the Financial Ombudsman Service or, if the claim is in relation to a life insurance policy held through a superannuation fund, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.

ASIC today released its review of the life insurance sector's handling of claims. The review found that, while life insurers are paying the considerable majority of claims, there are significant shortcomings in a number of areas of life insurance claims handling, and there is a clear need for public reporting on life insurance claims outcomes – at an industry and individual insurer level. 'Life insurance is a vitally important financial product that helps support consumers and their families at times of significant stress. Not being able to successfully claim on a life insurance policy can be financially devastating for the consumer and/or their family, so it's important that the industry operates in a way that is fair and transparent,' said Peter Kell. ASIC's review examined 15 insurers covering more than 90 per cent of the market. The six-month review analysed three years' of data on the four major life insurance policy types – term life cover, total and permanent disablement (TPD), trauma, and income protection. ASIC worked closely with APRA during the review. We note APRA's media release today. ASIC sought to identify whether there were systemic issues across the industry, as well as concerns relating to particular products or firms. The review also assessed whether industry data indicated the need for further, more targeted surveillance work. ASIC found that approximately 90% of claims are paid in the first instance with around $8.2billion in net policy payments made in the year ending 30 June 2016. While not finding evidence of cross-industry misconduct, ASIC's review identified issues of concern in relation to higher claims denial rates and claims handling procedures associated with: ASIC's review also found that there were higher claims denial rates in relation to insurance policies sold direct to consumers with no financial advice  (compared to policies sold through advisers and group insurance policies). ASIC has set out the following actions to improve standards in life insurance claims handling: To improve public trust, there is a clear need for better quality, more transparent and more consistent data on life insurance claims. ASIC's review found that data limitations, including inconsistent definitions across insurers, mean that care must be taken with current comparisons and follow up work will be required to better understand the claims performance of particular insurers or policies. ASIC and APRA will work with insurers and other stakeholders over 2017 to establish a consistent public reporting regime for claims data and claims outcomes, including claims handling timeframes and dispute levels across all policy types. Data will be made available on an industry and individual insurer basis. Currently 'insurance claims handling' is explicitly exempted from the financial services conduct provisions of the Corporations Law. ASIC is recommending that this exemption be removed by the Government and that more significant penalties for misconduct in relation to insurance claims handling are also included in the current review of ASIC's penalty powers. ASIC is recommending that the coverage of life insurance claims by dispute resolution schemes should be considered as part of the current inquiry into external dispute schemes (the Ramsay Review).  In particular, ASIC has highlighted the need to: ASIC will target the areas of concern we have identified from our review, applying targeted surveillances of particular insurers that have the highest decline rates and highest proportional dispute numbers, and examining TPD claims procedures and timeframes. ASIC will also conduct a major review of the life insurance sold without personal advice (also known as 'direct' life insurance). ASIC has made a number of recommendations for the insurance sector to undertake including:  These recommended responses should supplement the development of and compliance with the Life Insurance Code of Practice, to improve claims handling standards. As part of their ongoing development of the code, ASIC notes that industry could consider seeking approval of their code under ASIC's Regulatory Guide 183, Approval of financial service sector codes of conduct, as a signal to consumers that this is a code they can have confidence in.   In March 2016, the ABC Four Corners program and Fairfax Media publications jointly reported on a number of concerns about the life insurance claims handling practices of The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (trading as CommInsure). ASIC is also undertaking a separate investigation into the activities of CommInsure, following allegations in media coverage. An update on that review is also released today. In addition to our investigation of CommInsure, we undertook a review of claims handling practices across the life insurance industry. We reviewed data on claims from 15 insurers, estimated to make up over 90% of the life insurance market. The insurers included in this review are: We also conducted an analysis of claims-related disputes and reports of misconduct and undertook a targeted review of Product Disclosure Statements (PDSs) and policy documents to supplement the information provided by insurers. Our review covered the three year period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015, and assessed the four most common life insurance products: The review also assessed claims outcomes and trends by distribution channels, for the three main channels: Our review and this report follows another ASIC report reviewing life insurance products: see ASIC Report 413 Review of retail life insurance advice published in 2014.  This report found unacceptable levels of poor-quality advice and a strong correlation between high upfront commissions and poor consumer outcomes, including in situations where the recommendation was to switch products. Our follow-up work on this report is ongoing. Consumers who have concerns about their life insurance claim should contact their insurer's internal dispute resolution team. Consumers can also take a life insurance claim dispute to the Financial Ombudsman Service or, if the claim is in relation to a life insurance policy held through a superannuation fund, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Other queries about your life insurance cover can be raised with your insurer, your financial adviser, or your superannuation fund.

ASIC has released a consultation paper proposing to remake its class order on managed investment scheme buy-backs, currently due to expire (‘sunset’) on 1 April 2018, and proposed changes to platforms policy. ASIC proposes to remake the class order with minor changes.  In ASIC's view, the class order in general is operating effectively and efficiently and an amended version of the class order would continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework. The fundamental policy principles that underpin the class order have not changed. The new instrument would continue the relief currently given by [CO 07/422] On-market buy-backs by ASX-listed schemes without significant changes, so that the ongoing effect will be preserved without any disruption to the entities that rely on it. However, ASIC is proposing to: ASIC also seeks feedback on its proposed updates to the guidance on managed investment scheme buy-backs. Consultation Paper 269 Remaking ASIC class order on managed investment scheme buy-backs and updating related guidance (CP 269) outlines ASIC's rationale for proposing to remake the instrument and details of the updated regulatory guidance. The draft ASIC instrument, which reflects the amendments proposed in the consultation paper, can be viewed on our website (see: CP 269) Submissions on CP 269 are due by 23 November 2016. Under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, all class orders are repealed automatically or ‘sunset’ after a specified period of time (mostly 10 years) unless we take action to exempt or preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant. Where an instrument is considered to be operating effectively and efficiently and still serves a regulatory purpose we will consult on remaking it even if there will be no significant changes.

ASIC has re-issued an updated Information Sheet 214 Mining and resources: Forward-looking statements (INFO 214), on statements relating to future matters commonly made in the mining and resources industry. ASIC's goal is to draw together and better explain the existing rules on the disclosure of statements relating to future matters commonly made in the mining and resources industry, i.e., production targets and forecast financial information based on production targets. Revised INFO 214 incorporates some minor drafting changes to clarify our guidance. The changes have been made in response to concerns and misunderstandings that arose at the time of INFO 214's original release in April. We believe the revised guidance now provides companies with sufficient guidance and information to enable them to fully comply with their legal requirements. The matters clarified in revised INFO 214 are: ASIC Commissioner John Price thanked the Joint Ore Reserves Committee, the VALMIN Committee, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies and the Australian Securities Exchange for participating in discussions that have led to the revised guidance. 'ASIC recognises the importance of ensuring all in the industry have a shared understanding of the existing requirements for good disclosure, and this process has provided a valuable opportunity to enable that,' he said. 'Australia's mining industry has a world-recognised reputation for good operational and corporate practice - not least as a result of the JORC disclosure rules of more than 40 years' standing. 'ASIC looks forward to working with the industry to maintain our market's reputation.' Read INFO 214 Mining and resources: Forward-looking statements   forward looking statements have always under law been required to be based on reasonable grounds, and INFO 214 does not change this position; production targets and forecast financial information can be published even if secured funding is not in place - but a company still needs to be able to demonstrate 'reasonable grounds' that it could obtain the requisite project finance as and when required; production targets and forecast financial information can be published based not only on ore reserves but also on mineral resource estimates - provided they have 'reasonable grounds' for that estimated mineralisation, and each of the JORC Code modifying factors; and a company that does not have reasonable grounds for forward-looking statements and therefore cannot make statements of this kind should still disclose reliable and relevant information of a technical nature (for example, from scoping studies) to ensure the market is properly informed of the company's prospects.

Banks play a critical role in supporting economic growth and meeting the financial needs of Australian people. However, in recent times banks have fallen short of community expectations, as they themselves have acknowledged. Work is needed to restore trust and confidence. ASIC does see that the banks are taking important steps in the right direction to address this gap but they have a way to go on that journey. On this issue, ASIC has an important role to play. Our vision is: To allow markets to fund the economy, and in turn, economic growth. In doing so, contributing to the financial well-being of all Australians. We do this by: To this end, we have a range of work underway which we believe will contribute to increasing trust and confidence. Much of our work is focused on surveillance and enforcement. Our 4 year Corporate Plan which we released at the end of August sets out the work we will undertake in achieving our vision. This year we have also included our view of 'what good looks like' across the sectors we regulate. This, of course includes the banking and financial services industries. At the same time, the Government is progressing a number of important reforms that affect the work ASIC does, and which we believe will contribute to improving outcomes in banking and financial services. Over time, these well targeted reforms will contribute to increasing trust and confidence. Lastly, we would also like to comment on the importance of competition in driving positive consumer outcomes in the banking and financial services industry. Strong competition, both from new entrants and incumbents, encourages firms to innovate and has positive effects on price and quality.   promoting investor and consumer trust and confidence; ensuring fair and efficient markets; and providing efficient registration services.

On 19 September, the ASX equity market experienced a technical failure that impacted the proper operation of the market. This caused a delay to the market opening and an early market close, as well as generating a series of trade cancellations throughout the day. ASIC has reviewed the initial incident report prepared by ASX, which has identified a hardware failure as the triggering event of the particular incident.  Secondary issues arising from this failure are also being investigated by ASX, and we will also review the conclusions from this further work. ASIC closely monitors all trading activity on the securities markets run by our licensed market operators. As part of its role, ASIC is continuing to also review a number of associated considerations which arose on and from the incident which relate to the way in which ASX, brokers, investors and other stakeholders reacted and responded to the issue. Historically, Australian trading platforms like ASX have at least met global benchmarks for up-times and reliability, with up-times on an annual basis regularly close to 100 per cent.  The purpose of ASIC’s ongoing review is to determine whether there are any changes which could assist the market and market users to function more effectively, should such circumstances reoccur in the future. We will issue a report that develops these themes. This work will draw on our own observations, as well as industry feedback and perspectives on international approaches to incident management.

OPENING STATEMENT
WAYNE BYRES
Chairman
Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics
Canberra

OPENING STATEMENT
TO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDING COMMITTEE ON ECONOMICS
Thank you for the opportunity to appear today. This is a hearing into APRA’s 2015 Annual
Report, which I hope provides a clear and transparent account of our activities. But since
many issues discussed in that Report continue to have currency, and the Committee will
also want to discuss more contemporary issues, I plan to use my opening remarks to provide
an update on a few key areas of APRA’s work since that report was published. More detail
will, of course, be provided in our 2016 Annual Report, which will be tabled shortly.
Regulatory framework
APRA’s regulatory agenda in 2016 has been heavily influenced by the recommendations of
the Financial System Inquiry (FSI). In particular, we continue to improve the resilience of
the banking system to adversity, building on the lessons learned from the financial crisis. In
our bailiwick, this has included measures to strengthen bank capital, bolster the stability of
bank funding, and facilitate a simpler and more resilient securitisation market.
All of these initiatives are designed to improve the resilience of banking institutions. But
even with more resilience, preparing for a possible crisis involving one or more regulated
institutions with serious threats to their immediate viability is also a wise investment. We
therefore welcomed the Treasurer’s recent commitment to pursue proposed legislative
improvements to the statutory toolkit for crisis management, as recommended by the FSI,
as a matter of priority. We would also appreciate this Committee’s support when these
proposals come before the Parliament.
Housing lending standards
Our supervisory work on housing lending standards has remained a high priority in 2016.
There is no shortage of competition for the business of home loan borrowers, but we are
keen to see the industry’s competitive instincts directed towards pricing, product features
and customer service, rather than pursuing market share by reducing the quality of loans
written. Therefore, the goal of our recent work has been to reinforce – and in some areas
improve - sound lending standards for housing, particularly in relation to the manner in
which lenders assess the capacity of borrowers to service their loans. In response to our
attention, we believe the industry has appreciably improved its lending standards: for
example, all material lenders are now assessing borrower serviceability using interest rate
buffers of at least 2 per cent, and a minimum rate of at least 7 per cent, and some of the
overly generous assumptions in affordability models have been tightened up. We continue
to monitor the evolving risks in the property market, and are working to have improved
standards firmly embedded into industry practice, so they are not eroded away over time.
Risk culture
For the past couple of years, we have given greater attention to the risk culture within
regulated institutions. Risk culture is, in simple terms, the way in which the organisation’s
culture shapes its attitude to risk-taking and risk management. Assessing risk culture is no
easy task. But if an organisation has a poor attitude to risk-taking and risk management, it
can ultimately threaten an institution’s financial viability. We saw examples of poor risk
culture at the heart of many failures that occurred internationally during the GFC; before
that, the demise of HIH Insurance was an example closer to home.
It is important to note that prudential and conduct regulators – that is, APRA and ASIC – both
have a legitimate interest in the culture within financial institutions, but that our respective
interests stem from different underlying objectives. ASIC's focus on culture is from the
perspective of ensuring fair outcomes for customers and investors. APRA’s focus on risk 
3
culture reflects our prudential mandate - that as a result of undesirable behaviours and
attitudes towards risk-taking and risk management, the viability of an APRA-regulated
institution itself - and in severe cases, financial stability – might be threatened. While we
start with different objectives, our shared interest means APRA and ASIC need to work
collaboratively on culture-related matters - and we are doing that.
APRA’s work over the past year or so has focussed on how Boards assess the risk culture
within their organisation, given the introduction of specific prudential requirements in this
area from January 2015. We will very shortly publish an information paper on industry
activity in relation to understanding and assessing risk culture. In the year ahead, we will
continue to refine our approach and methodologies for making assessments of risk culture
within regulated institutions, and be looking more closely at the influence of remuneration
arrangements on that culture.
Life insurance claims review
As the Committee knows well, there have been serious allegations of inappropriate and
unfair treatment of a number of claimants by The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
Limited, trading as CommInsure. While ASIC is dealing with specific customer cases, APRA
takes a close interest in such matters, given they can provide important insights into the
strength of an institution’s governance, risk management and risk culture. Therefore,
working alongside ASIC, we commenced three streams of work:                                          
? We engaged with the Board and senior management of CommInsure to gain assurance
over the robustness and completeness of the independent reviews commissioned to
investigate the allegations, and to ensure a focus on stakeholder and community
expectations through this process.                     
? We met with the whistleblower that brought the CommInsure matters to public
attention, and are considering whether the whistleblowing provisions in the Life
Insurance Act 1995, which are designed to prevent the identification and victimisation
of whistleblowers, have been adhered to in this matter.                                      
? We wrote to the Boards of all active life insurers to seek information about the
effectiveness of their governance and oversight mechanisms for matters such as claims
handling, benefit definitions, rejected claims and customer complaints. We similarly
wrote to a selection of superannuation trustees, as some of the claimants that had
experienced unacceptable outcomes were members of group risk schemes via their
superannuation funds. Summaries of the key themes from APRA’s analysis of responses
to these information requests were released earlier this week.
Our work in each of these streams is ongoing.
Concluding remarks
Underlying all of the work I have just spoken about is our firm conviction that a strong,
stable and competitive financial sector is essential for the ongoing prosperity of the
Australian community. Importantly, we do not see enhanced safety as necessarily requiring
a trade-off with competition. Rather, the two are complementary since only sound financial
institutions will be able to support their customers – both existing and new – through good
times and bad. Australia needs regulated institutions that make an adequate return for their
owners such that they remain attractive to new investment, while at the same time
providing products and services to their customers that offer value for money and perform
consistently with expectations. Business models and products that only support the
community when times are good do not provide the lasting benefits of competition. Put
simply, only sound institutions operating with the interests of their full range of stakeholders 
4
in mind, and with a long term perspective, are able to provide real and sustainable service
to the community. Through our activities, we hope we are helping to shape the financial
system in that direction.
With those remarks, my colleagues and I are happy to answer the Committee’s questions.

ASIC today released a consultation paper proposing to remake four class orders on registered schemes, which are due to expire (‘sunset’) between 1 October 2017 and April 2018. The instruments that ASIC proposes to remake are: ASIC considers that these class orders are operating effectively and efficiently and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework. The fundamental policy principles that underpin the class orders have not changed. ASIC proposes to remake the relief under these class orders in a single legislative instrument so that the substantive effect of each class order is continued beyond its expiration date. The new instrument will continue the relief currently given by the class orders without significant changes, so that the ongoing effect will be preserved without any disruption to the entities that rely on them. In relation to Class Order [CO 98/1808], it is also proposed that the relief be extended to apply in relation to the listing rules of the Sydney Stock Exchange and may in the future apply in relation to the listing rules of other financial markets that require or allow for the constitution of a registered scheme to contain provisions similar in effect to those in Appendix 15A of the ASX Listing Rules. Consultation Paper 270 Remaking ASIC class orders on registered schemes (CP 270) outlines ASIC's rationale for proposing to remake the class orders. The draft ASIC instrument, which reflects the amendments proposed in the consultation paper, is available on our website under CP 270. Submissions on CP 270 are due by 25 November 2016. Under the Legislation Act 2003, all class orders sunset after a specified period of time (mostly ten years) unless we take action to exempt or preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant. Where an instrument is considered to be operating effectively and efficiently and still serves a regulatory purpose, we will consult on remaking it even if there will be no significant changes.

ASIC notes that Frontier Capital Group Limited (Frontier) has amended the presentation of its goodwill impairment expense for the half-year ended 30 June 2016. In Frontier’s Appendix 4D lodged with ASX on 31 August 2016, Frontier recognised an impairment expense of $7,965,389 in other comprehensive income rather than net loss. This is contrary to the requirements of the accounting standards. In response to an enquiry by ASIC, Frontier has released an amended Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and other Comprehensive Income which presents the impairment expense as a component of the net loss for the period. Total comprehensive loss for the period remains unchanged. ASIC made enquiries about the recoverability of goodwill as part of its review of the financial report of Frontier for the year ended 31 December 2015.

ASIC has made a new legislative instrument to replace Class Order [CO 02/225] Rights issue notifications, which was due to expire (‘sunset’) on 1 April 2017. The new legislative instrument is ASIC Corporations (Renounceable Rights Issue Notifications) Instrument 2016/993. The instrument has substantially the same effect as [CO 02/225]. It provides relief from certain sections of Chapter 6D and Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act 2001 to facilitate the renunciation and transfer of rights issued under a renounceable rights offer.  ASIC has also repealed Class Order [CO 00/231] Money market deposits, which was due to sunset on 1 April 2017. Class Order [CO 00/231] was repealed as the relief provided by the class order is no longer necessary in light of other provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 and any residual need for relief is more appropriately given on a case by case basis by application. ASIC consulted on its proposal to continue the relief in [CO 02/225] without substantive changes and to repeal [CO 00/231] in Consultation Paper 261 Remaking and repealing ASIC class orders on rights issue notifications and money market deposits (CP 261), released 15 June 2016. Comments closed on 15 July 2016 (refer: 16-193MR). We received one submission to CP 261, which was supportive of our proposals. Under the Legislation Act 2003, all class orders are repealed automatically or ‘sunset’ after a period of time (mostly 10 years) unless we take action to preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up to date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant.

Mr Mark McIvor, former Chief executive officer and founding director of Equititrust Limited (in liquidation) (Equititrust) remains permanently banned from providing financial services after withdrawing an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to appeal against ASIC's original banning decision. Mr McIvor was permanently banned from providing financial services on 2 September 2015 following an earlier ASIC investigation into the collapse of Equititrust. At that time, Equititrust held an Australian financial services (AFS) licence and was the responsible entity of two registered schemes; Equititrust Income Fund (EIF) and the Equititrust Priority Class Income Fund (EPCIF) and was also the trustee of Equititrust Premium Fund (EPF); an unregistered managed investment scheme. An ASIC delegate found that whilst he was the director of Equititrust, Mr McIvor contravened a financial services law and was not of good fame or character to provide financial services. His conduct involved breaches of the financial services legislation which were considered to be very serious, repetitive, prolonged and dishonest. In particular, the ASIC delegate found that Mr McIvor contravened financial services laws by: Mr McIvor subsequently filed applications for a review of ASIC's decision to permanently ban him from providing financial services and to stay the operation and implementation of the  banning order. The stay application was refused by the AAT (refer 16-181MR) and on 1 September 2016, Mr McIvor withdrew his application for review of ASIC's decision to permanently ban him from financial services. ASIC Commissioner John Price said Mr McIvor's conduct was at the most serious end of the offending range and that it was appropriate he be permanently banned from providing financial services. 'People who provide financial services, especially those in senior management positions, are required to discharge their obligations under financial services laws efficiently, honestly and fairly. ASIC will ensure those who fail in these duties are removed from the industry,' Mr Price said. Equititrust was incorporated on 18 August 1993 and was placed into voluntary administration on 15 February 2012.  The creditors of Equititrust resolved that the company should be placed into liquidation on 20 April 2012.  The voluntary administrators of Equititrust reported that as at the date of their appointment: On 19 December 2011, ASIC suspended Equititrust's AFSL for 12 months, for failing to comply with a number of key obligations as a financial services licensee (refer 11-306MR). Equititrust's AFSL remains suspended.  On 22 August 2014, Mr McIvor was convicted and fined $10,000 in the Brisbane Magistrates Court of six charges of failing to provide a Report as to Affairs and to deliver books and records to the liquidators of Chevron Capital Pty Ltd, MHSM Holdings Pty Ltd and SM Capital Pty Ltd (refer 14-223MR). Mr McIvor was made bankrupt on 28 November 2012, however, his bankruptcy period has since expired.   signing 28 board meeting minutes, which falsely recorded a board meeting to approve a loan application had occurred, when no such board meeting had taken place, and in doing so, Equititrust did not meet its obligations under EIFs Compliance Plan; and failing to take all the steps that a reasonable person would take, if they were in Mr McIvor's position, namely to ensure that accurate, true and correct documents were relied upon for compliance checks and not be involved in the production of false documents. EIF had about 1620 unitholders who were owed approximately $203.6mil; EPF had about 38 unitholders who were owed approximately $56.7mil; and EPCIF had 5 unitholders and held no tangible assets.
