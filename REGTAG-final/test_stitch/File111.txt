Comments due 12 September 2016. This consultation paper sets out ASIC’s proposals to remake our class orders relating to audit and financial reporting relief. Under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, these class orders will expire (‘sunset’) if not remade. We are seeking feedback from preparers of financial statements on our proposals to remake, without significant changes, [CO 98/1417] and [CO 98/1418], which are due to expire on 1 October 2016, and [CO 01/1256], which is due to expire on 1 April 2017. We are also seeking feedback on our proposals to:  update Regulatory Guide 115 Audit relief for proprietary companies (RG 115); update pro formas—PFs 24, 25, 26, 27 and 183; and repeal [CO 98/106], which is due to expire on 1 October 2017, and [CO 99/1225], which is due to expire on 1 October 2016.
