(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular Article 49(3) and (4) thereof,  

Whereas:  

(1)

(3)

 

A  tick  size  regime  or  minimum  tick  sizes  should  be  set  out  in  respect  of  certain 
financial  instruments  to  ensure  the  orderly  functioning  of  the  markets.  In  particular, 
the risk of an ever-decreasing tick size for shares, depositary receipts and certain types 
of  exchange-traded  funds  and  its  impact  on  the  orderliness  of  the  market  should  be 
controlled by means of a compulsory tick size regime. 

For  other  financial  instruments,  given  the  nature  of  these  instruments  and  the 
microstructures of the markets on which they are traded, the enactment of a tick size 
regime  for  those  instruments  cannot  be  presumed  to  effectively  contribute  to  the 
orderliness  of  the  markets  and,  hence,  these  instruments  should  not  be  subject  to  a 
mandatory tick size regime.  

In particular, certificates are only traded in certain Member States. Having taken into 
consideration  the  liquidity,  scale  and  nature  of  these  specific  markets  and  the 
characteristics of those financial instruments, no mandatory tick size regime is deemed 
necessary to prevent the occurrence of disorderly trading conditions.  

(4)

  With  respect  to  non-equity  financial  instruments  and  fixed  income  products,  a  large 
proportion  of  trading  remains  executed  OTC  with  only  a  limited  number  of

transactions  being  executed  on-venue.  Due  to  the  specific  characteristics  of  the 
liquidity of these instruments on electronic platforms and their fragmentation it is not 
deemed necessary to regulate a mandatory tick size regime for them.  

The  correlation  between  exchange-traded  funds  (ETFs)  and  the  underlying  equity 
instruments  makes  necessary  the  determination  of  a  minimum  tick  size  for  ETFs 
having  as  underlying  shares  and  depositary  receipts.  However,  ETFs  having  as 
underlying financial instruments which are not shares or depositary receipts should not 
be subject to these regulatory technical standards. 

For  ETFs,  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  circumvention,  it  is  important  that  all  ETFs 
covered by this Regulation have the same tick size regime based on a single liquidity 
band regardless of their average daily number of transactions. 

A  certain  number  of  technical  terms  should  be  clearly  defined  for  the  purposes  of 
setting  out  a  tick  size  regime.  Those  technical  definitions  are  necessary  to  ensure 
objective, effective and  harmonised application of the tick size regimes  in  the Union 
and,  hence,  contribute  to  the  establishment  of  a  single  rulebook  for  Union  financial 
markets in that respect. In particular, it appears essential to clarify the meaning of the 
most relevant market in terms of liquidity since Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council2 establishes two different definitions of most 
relevant market in terms of liquidity respectively for the purpose of the reference price 
waiver and for the purpose of transaction reporting. 

The  tick  size  regime  only  determines  the  minimum  difference  between  two  price 
levels  of  orders  sent  in  relation  to  a  financial  instrument  in  the  order-book.  As  a 
consequence,  it  should  be  applied  equally  regardless  of  the  currency  of  the  financial 
instrument. 

Competent authorities should have the ability to react to events known in advance that 
lead to a change in the number of transactions in a financial instrument whereby, as a 
result,  the  applicable  tick  size  may  no  longer  be  appropriate.  To  that  end,  a  specific 
procedure  should  be  set  out  to  avoid  disorderly  market  conditions  arising  from 
corporate  actions  that  may  cause  the  tick  size  of  one  specific  instrument  to  be 
unsuitable.  That  procedure  should  apply  to  corporate  actions  that  could  affect 
significantly  the  liquidity  of  this  instrument  including  splits,  reverse  splits,  scrip 
issues,  capital  repayments,  rights  issues,  entitlement  offers,  takeovers,  mergers  and 
stock  conversions.  While  assessing  the  impact  of  a  corporate  action  on  a  specific 
financial  instrument,  competent  authorities  should  take  account  of  any  previous 
corporate actions with similar characteristics.

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council3 applies  from  3  January 
2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from the 
same date. However, to ensure that the tick size regime can operate effectively from 3 
January 2017, and that market participants have sufficient time to implement the new 
requirements  by  that  date,  it  is  necessary  for  certain  transitional  provisions  to  apply 
from  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  this  Regulation.  These  transitional  provisions 
should  enable  the  collection  of  data  for  the  calculations  and  provide  for  an  earlier 
publication of the average  daily  number of transactions for each  financial  instrument 
covered by this Regulation. 

(11)

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

(12)

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council4, 

 

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 

 

Article 1  

Definitions 

For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply: 

(1)

 

‘most relevant market in terms of liquidity’ means the most relevant market in terms 
of  liquidity  as  defined  in  Article  4(1)(a)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  and 
specified  in  Article  4  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  [xxxx/xxxx] 
[Draft  RTS  1  on  transparency  requirements  for  equity  and  equity-like  financial 
instruments];  

(2)

 

‘liquidity  band’  means  the  liquidity  range  based  on  the  average  daily  number  of 
transactions for a given financial instrument as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Article 2 

(Article 49(1) and (2) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Tick size for shares, depositary receipts and exchange-traded funds  

1.  Trading venues shall apply to orders in shares or depositary receipts a tick size which is 
equal to or greater than the one corresponding to: 

(a)  the  liquidity  band  in  the  table  in  the  Annex  to  this  Regulation  corresponding  with  the 
average  daily  number  of  transactions  in  the  most  relevant  market  in  terms  of  liquidity 
for that instrument;   

(b)  the price range in that liquidity band corresponding to the price of the order. 

2.  By  way  of  derogation  from  paragraph  1(a),  where  the  most  relevant  market  in  terms  of 
liquidity  for  a  share  or  depositary  receipt  operates  only  a  periodic  auction  trading  system, 
trading  venues  shall  apply  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  the  lowest  average  daily 
number of transactions in the table in the Annex. 

For the purpose of the first subparagraph, a trading system shall be deemed to be a periodic 
auction trading system where orders are matched on the basis of a periodic auction and of a 
trading algorithm operated without human intervention. 

3.  Trading venues shall apply to orders in ETFs a tick size which is equal to or greater than 
the one corresponding to: 

(a)  the  liquidity  band  in  the  table  in  the  Annex  to  this  Regulation  corresponding  with  the 

highest average daily number of transactions;   

(b)  the price range in that liquidity band according to the price of the order. 

4.  The  requirements  set  out  in  paragraph  3  shall  apply  only  to  ETFs  having  as  sole 
underlying equities or a basket of equities subject to the tick size regime under paragraph 1.  

 

Article 3 

(Article 49(1) and (2) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Average daily number of transactions for shares and depositary receipts  

1.  By 1 March 2018 and by 1 March of each year thereafter, the competent authority for a 
specific share or depositary receipt shall, when determining the most relevant market in terms 
of  liquidity  for  that  share  or  depositary  receipt  also  calculate  the  average  daily  number  of 
transactions  for  that  financial  instrument  in  that  market  and  ensure  the  publication  of  that 
information.  

EN 

304 

EN 

 
 

 

 

The competent authority in the first sub-paragraph shall be the one specified in Article XX of 
Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  [insert  reference  to  Article  18  of  RTS  on  reporting 
obligations under Article 26 of MiFIR].  

2.  The calculation referred to in paragraph 1 shall have the following characteristics: 

(a)  it shall cover the period in the preceding year beginning on 1 January and ending on 31 
December  or,  where  applicable,  that  part  of  the  year  during  which  the  financial 
instrument was admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue and was not suspended 
from trading;  

(b)  it  shall  include  transactions  executed  under  the  rules  of  the  relevant  trading  venue 
excluding reference price and negotiated transactions as set out in Table 4 of Annex I of 
[RTS  1  on  equity  transparency]  and  transactions  executed  on  the  basis  of  at  least  one 
order that has benefitted from a large in scale waiver and where the transactions’ size is 
above the applicable large in scale threshold as determined in accordance with Article 7 
of [RTS 1 on equity transparency].  

This paragraph and paragraph 1 shall not apply to shares and depositary receipts first admitted 
to trading or traded on a trading venue after 30 November of the preceding year. 

3.  Trading  venues  shall  apply  the  tick  sizes  of  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  the 
average  daily  number  of  transactions  as  published  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  from  1 
April following that publication.  

4.  Before  the  first  admission  to  trading  or  before  the  first  day  of  trading  of  a  share  or 
depositary receipt, the competent authority of the trading venue where that instrument is to be 
first  admitted  to  trading  or  first  traded  shall  estimate  and  publish  the  estimate  average  daily 
number of transactions for that venue, taking into account the previous trading history of that 
instrument, where applicable, as well as the trading history of instruments that are considered 
to have similar characteristics.  

The  tick  size  of  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  that  published  estimate  average  daily 
number of transactions shall apply immediately after the publication of that estimate and until 
the publication of the average daily number of transactions for that instrument in accordance 
with paragraph 5. 

5.  No  later  than  six  weeks  after  the  share  or  depositary  receipt  has  started  trading,  the 
competent authority of the trading venue where the instrument was first admitted to trading or 
first traded on a trading venue shall calculate and ensure the publication of the average daily 
number of transactions in that financial instrument for that venue using the data relating to the 
first four weeks of trading of that financial instrument.  

The  tick  size  of  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  that  published  average  daily  number  of 
transactions  shall  apply  immediately  after  the  publication  and  continue  to  apply  until  a  new 

EN 

305 

EN 

 
 

 

 

average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  that  instrument  calculated  and  published  in 
accordance with the procedure set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 applies.  

6.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Article,  the  average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  a  given 
financial  instrument  shall  be  calculated  by  dividing,  for  the  relevant  time  period  and  the 
relevant  trading venue, the total  number of transactions in  that instrument  by the number of 
trading days. 

 

Article 4 

(Article 49(1) and (2) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Corporate actions 

Where a competent authority considers that a corporate action may modify the average daily 
number of transactions of a particular financial instrument such that this financial instrument 
falls  within  a  different  liquidity  band,  the  competent  authority  shall  determine  and  make 
public a new applicable liquidity band for that financial instrument treating it as if it were first 
admitted to trading or first traded on a trading venue and apply the procedure set out in Article 
3(4) and (5). 

 

Article 5 

Transitional provisions  

1.  The competent authority of the trading venue where a share or depositary receipt was first 
admitted  to  trading  or  traded  for  first  time  shall  collect  the  necessary  data,  calculate  and 
ensure  the  publication  of  the  average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  that  financial 
instrument and for that trading venue:  

(a)  by  1  December  2016  for  financial  instruments  traded  for  the  first  time  on  a  trading 

venue before 21 October 2016; 

(b)  by 3 January 2017 for financial instruments traded for the first time on a trading venue 

between 21 October 2016 and 2 January 2017. 

2.  The calculations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on: 

(a)  available  data  for  the  period  from  1  January  2016  to  30  September  2016  for  financial 
instruments first admitted to trading or traded for first time on a trading venue before 1 
September 2016; 

(b)  available data for the first four weeks of trading for financial instruments first admitted 
to trading or traded for first time on a trading venue between 1 September 2016 and 20 
October 2016; 

EN 

306

(c)  previous  trading  history  of  that  financial  instrument  or  of  other  financial  instruments 
considered  to  have  similar  characteristics  for  financial  instruments  first  admitted  to 
trading  or  traded  for  first  time  in  the  Union  between  21  October  2016  and  2  January 
2017. 

3.  The tick sizes of the liquidity band corresponding to that published average daily number 
of  transactions  shall  apply  from  3  January  2017  to  31  March  2018.  During  that  period, 
competent  authorities  shall  ensure  for  financial  instruments  referred  to  under  points  (b)  and 
(c) of paragraph 2 and for which they are the competent authority that those tick sizes do not 
contribute to disorderly trading conditions. Where a competent  authority identifies a risk for 
the  orderly  functioning  of  the  markets  for  such  an  instrument,  it  shall  determine  and  make 
public  an  updated  average  daily  number  of  transactions  for  that  financial  instrument  to 
address that risk on the basis of longer and more comprehensive trading history data for that 
instrument.  Trading  venues  shall  apply  the  liquidity  band  corresponding  to  this  updated 
average  daily  number  of  transactions  immediately  and  until  1  April  2018  or  any  further 
publication by the competent authority in accordance with this paragraph. 

 

Article 6 

Entry into force and application 

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in 
the Official Journal of the European Union. 

It shall apply from 3 January 2017, except Article 5 which shall apply immediately following 
the entry into force of this Regulation.  

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
