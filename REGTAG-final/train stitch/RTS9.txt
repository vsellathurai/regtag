Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the ratio of 

unexecuted orders to transactions 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular Article 48(12)(b) thereof, 

Whereas:

Trading  venues  should  have  a  number  of  systems,  procedures  and  arrangements  in 
place  to  ensure  that  algorithmic  trading  systems  cannot  create  or  contribute  to 
disorderly  trading  conditions  including  systems  to  monitor  and,  where  appropriate, 
limit  the ratio of unexecuted orders to  transactions. Taking into  account  their nature, 
voice  trading  systems  should  be  exempt  from  the  scope  of  this  regulation  which 
should  only  apply  to  trading  venues  operating  electronic  continuous  auction  order 
book, quote-driven or hybrid trading systems. 

Directive  2014/65/EU  extends  the  requirements  relating  to  the  determination  of  the 
ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  to  multilateral  trading  facilities  and 
organised  trading  facilities  and  it  is  therefore  important  that  those  venues  are  also 
within the scope of these regulatory technical standards. 

Trading venues have the ability to set out the maximum ratio of unexecuted orders to 
transactions  at  the  level  they  deem  appropriate,  for  instance  per  group  of  financial 
instruments with similar characteristics. However, trading venues should calculate the 
ratio effectively incurred by their members or participants at the level of each financial 
instrument  traded  on  them  to  ensure  effectively  that  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders 
does not lead to excessive volatility in that instrument. 

(4)

 

In order to ensure sufficient harmonisation across the Union of these arrangements, a 
clear  methodology  to  calculate  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  with 
respect to all market participants should be laid down.

The meaning of certain essential parameters to be used for the calculation of the ratio 
of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  should  be  clarified.  Definitions  are  an  essential 
element of the methodology and should therefore be set out in order to avoid divergent 
application across the Union.  

The  calculation  of  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  entered  into  the 
system  by  a  member  or  participant  should  be  supported  by  an  adequate  observation 
period. On that basis, the calculation period of the effective ratio of unexecuted orders 
to  transactions  should  not  be  longer  than  a  trading  session.  However,  trading  venues 
should  be  allowed  to  set  out  shorter  observation  periods  in  case  such  shorter 
observation  periods  would  contribute  more  effectively  to  maintain  orderly  trading 
conditions.   

Trading venues should be able to identify whether the observed pattern of the ratio of 
unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  of  any  of  their  members  or  participants  may 
contribute to disorderly trading conditions and to take measures considered necessary 
even if the maximum ratio has not been effectively breached. 

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date. 

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council2, 

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 

 

Article 1

No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

Obligation to calculate the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions 

Trading  venues  shall  calculate  the  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  effectively 
entered  into  the  system  by  each  of  their  members  and  participants  and  for  every  financial 
instrument traded under an electronic continuous auction order book, quote-driven or hybrid 
trading system. 

 

Article 2  

(Article 48(6) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Definitions 

For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply: 

(a)  ‘order’  means  all  input messages,  including  submission,  modification  and  cancellation 
sent  to  a  trading  venue’s  trading  system  relating  to  an  order  or  a  quote,  but  excluding 
cancellation messages sent subsequent to: 

(i)  uncrossing in an auction; 

(ii)  a loss of venue connectivity;  

(iii) the use of a kill functionality. 

(b)  ‘transaction’ means a totally or partially executed order;  

(c)  ‘volume’ means the quantity of financial instruments traded expressed as:  

(i)  the number of instruments for shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and 

other similar financial instruments;  

(ii)  the nominal value for bonds and structured finance products;  

(iii) the number of lots size or contracts for derivatives;  

(iv) metric tonnes of carbon dioxide for emission allowances. 

 

Article 3 

(Article 48(6) of Directive 2014/65/EU) 

Methodology  

1.  Trading venues shall calculate the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions for each of 
their  members  or  participants  at  least  at  the  end  of  every  trading  session  in  both  of  the 
following ways:  

EN 

287 

EN 

 
 

 

 

(a)  in volume terms: 

(Total volume of orders/Total volume of transactions) - 1;  

(b)  in number terms: 

(Total number of orders/Total number of transactions) - 1. 

2.  The maximum ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions determined by the trading venue 
shall be deemed as being exceeded by a member or participant of the trading venue during a 
trading session if the trading activity of that member or participant in one specific instrument, 
taking into account all phases of the trading session including the auctions, exceeds either of 
the two ratios set out in paragraph 1.  

3.  Trading  venues  shall  calculate  the  number  of  orders  effectively  received  from  each 
member  or  participant  following  the  counting  methodology  per  order  type  set  out  in  the 
Annex.  

4.  Where a trading venue uses an order type which is not explicitly laid down in the Annex, 
it  shall  count  the  messages  in  accordance  with  the  general  systematic  behind  the  counting 
methodology and as the most similar order type appearing in the Annex. 

 

Article 4  

Entry into force and application  

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth following that of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union. 

It shall apply from 3 January 2017. 

 

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

TOP, TOP+ either placed 
on the top of the book or 
rejected (+: check on the 
available volume): an 
order which has to be 
both passive and at the 
BBO, failing which it is 
rejected. 

Imbalance Order (IOOP 
or IOOC): an order which 
is only valid for auctions 
and which aims at filling 
the quantity imbalance 
(between the surplus and 
deficit sides) without 
affecting the price 
equilibrium. 

Linked order: an order 
which corresponds to a 
number of single orders 
each of which being on a 
different financial 
instrument. When a trade 
takes place on one of 
these orders, the volume 
of the other ones will be 
immediately reduced 
proportionally. This order 
type is typically used on 
the bond market. 

Sweep: allows 
participants to access 
integrated order-books. 

Best price sweep: work 
through price levels from 
the combined order 
books, to the limit price
