supplementing Directive (EU) No 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament

suspension and removal of financial instruments from trading 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1, and in particular the tenth subparagraph of Article 32(2) and the tenth 
subparagraph of Article 52(2) thereof,  

Whereas: 

(1)

 

(2)

 

(3)

 

The objective of a suspension or removal from trading of a financial instrument will in 
some  cases  not  be  achieved  unless  a  derivative  of  a  type  referred  to  in  points  (4)  to 
(10)  of  Section  C  of  Annex  I  to  Directive  2014/65/EU  relating  or  referenced  to  that 
financial instrument is also suspended or removed from trading.  

In  determining  cases  where  the  connection  is  such  that  it  is  necessary  to  suspend  or 
remove related derivatives, the strength of the connection between the derivative and 
the  financial  instrument  that  is  suspended  or  removed  from  trading  should  be 
considered.  In  this  respect,  a  distinction  should  be  made  between  a  derivative  for 
which the formation of its price or value is dependent on the  price or value of a sole 
underlying  financial  instrument,  and  derivatives  for  which  the  price  or  value  is 
dependent  on  multiple  price  inputs,  for  instance,  derivatives  related  to  an  index  or  a 
basket of financial instruments.  

The  inability  to  correctly  price  related  derivatives,  leading  to  a  disorderly  market, 
should  be  considered  the  strongest  for  the  cases  where  the  derivative  is  related  or 
referenced  to  only  one  financial  instrument.  When  the  derivative  is  related  or 
referenced  to  a  basket  of  financial  instruments  or  an  index  of  which  the  suspended 
financial instrument is only one part, the ability of market participants to determine the 
correct  price  would  be  less  affected.  Thus  the  characteristics  of  the  connection

between the derivative and the underlying should be taken into account in considering 
the overall objective of the suspension or removal.  

It  should be taken into account  that a market  operator has to  ensure fair, orderly and 
efficient trading in its market. Outside the scope of this Regulation, a market operator 
will need to make an assessment of whether the suspension or removal from trading of 
the  underlying  financial  instrument  endangers  the  fair  and  orderly  trading  of  the 
derivative  in  its  trading  venue,  including  taking  appropriate  action  such  as  the 
suspension or removal of related derivatives on its own initiative.  

The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  specifying 
the  suspensions  and  removals  on  different  types  of  trading  venues.  To  ensure 
coherence  between  those  provisions,  which  should  enter  into  force  at  the  same  time, 
and to facilitate a comprehensive view for stakeholders and, in particular, those subject 
to the obligations it is necessary to consolidate the regulatory technical standards in a 
single Regulation. 

The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 2 applies  from  3  January 
2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from the 
same date.   

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council3. 

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
