THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU)

For  the  purpose  of  effective  market  monitoring  by  competent  authorities,  reference 
data for financial instruments should be reported in a consistent format and according 
to uniform standards.  

Reporting  and  publication  of  reference  data  in  electronic,  machine-readable  and 
downloadable form and format facilitates the efficient use and exchange of that data. 

Promptly  receiving  reference  data  in  respect  of  all  financial  instruments  that  were 
admitted  to  trading  or  that  were  traded  on  a  trading  venue  or  systematic  internaliser 
enables  competent  authorities  and  the  European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority 
(ESMA)  to  ensure  data  quality  and  effective  market  monitoring,  to  the  benefit  of 
market integrity.  

For the purposes of efficient use and exchange of reference data, and in order to ensure 
that  reference  data  are  consistent  with  corresponding  data  provided  in  transaction 
reports,  trading  venues  and  systematic  internalisers  must  base  the  identification  of 
financial instruments and legal entities to be included in the reference data on uniform 
accepted standards. 

(5)

 

Senders  and  recipients  of  reference  data  must  ensure  the  effective  receipt,  efficient 
exchange  and  quality  of  the  data  and  its  consistency  with  corresponding  transaction

reports provided in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. In this sense, trading 
venues  and  systematic  internalisers  should  provide  complete  and  accurate  reference 
data and should promptly inform competent authorities of identified incompleteness or 
inaccuracy in data already provided. They should also maintain adequate systems and 
controls for the purpose of accurate, complete and timely provision of reference data. 

In  order  to  ensure  that  reference  data  are  matched  with  corresponding  transaction 
reports,  trading  venues  and  systematic  internalisers  should  ensure  that  ISIN  codes  in 
accordance  with  ISO  6166  pertaining  to  the  financial  instruments  being  reported  are 
obtained and included in the reported data.  

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council2. 

The application of this Regulation should be deferred in order to align its applicability 
with  the  application  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  Article  27  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014,
