supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the 

Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the data to be 
provided by execution venues on the quality of execution of transactions 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

 

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,  

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having regard to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 
May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending  Directive  2002/92/EC  and 
Directive 2011/61/EU1 and in  particular point (a)  of the first  subparagraph of Article 27(10) 
thereof, 

Whereas: 

(1)

  With a view to provide the public, and including investment firms, with relevant data 
on execution quality to help them determine the best way to execute client orders, it is 
important to set out the specific content, the format and the periodicity of data relating 
to  the  quality  of  execution  to  be  published  on  financial  instruments  subject  to  the 
trading obligation in Articles 23 and 28 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council(2) by trading venues and systematic internalisers and for 
other financial instruments by execution venues. In this respect, due regard should be 
given to the type of execution venue and the type of financial instrument concerned.  

(2)

 

In order to fully assess the extent of the quality of execution of transactions that take 
place  in  the  European  Union,  it  is  appropriate  that  execution  venues  which  can  be 
selected  by  investment  firms  for  the  execution  of  the  orders  of  their  clients  are 
required to  comply  with  requirements on data to be provided by  execution venues in 
accordance with this Regulation. To this effect, these execution venues should include 
regulated  markets,  multilateral  trading  facilities,  systematic  internalisers,  market 
makers  or  other  liquidity  providers,  which  are  identified  as  execution  venues  in 
accordance  with  Article  44  of  Commission  Directive  2006/73/EC.  Organised  trading 

                                                 

1 OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349. 
2 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in 
financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 84).

facilities should also  be  included in  order to  take account of the recognition  of these 
venues as trading venues in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EC. 

Differences  in  the  type  of  execution  venue  and  financial  instruments  require  that  the 
content  of  reporting  should  vary  depending  on  several  factors.  It  is  appropriate  to 
differentiate  the  amount  and  nature  of  reported  data  according  to  trading  systems, 
trading  modes  and  trading  platforms  to  provide  a  proper  context  for  the  quality  of 
execution obtained. 

To  avoid  inappropriate  comparison  between  execution  venues  and  ensure  the 
relevance  of  collected  data,  execution  venues  should  submit  separate  reports 
corresponding  to  segments  that  operate  different  order  books  or  that  are  regulated 
differently or use different market segment identifiers. 

In  order  to  provide  an  accurate  picture  of  the  quality  of  execution  that  effectively 
occurred, trading venues should not publish among executed trades those traded over 
the counter and reported onto the trading venue.   

(6)

  When reporting as execution venues for financial instruments not subject to the trading 
obligations,  market  makers  and  other  liquidity  providers  should  only  publish 
information on the orders executed or any price quoted for their clients, when offered 
or  executed  over  the  counter,  or  executed  pursuant  to  Article  4  and  9  of  Regulation 
(EU)  No  600/2014  except  orders  held  in  an  order  management  facility  of  a  trading 
venue pending disclosure.   

(7)

 

(8)

 

(9)

 

It  is  appropriate  to  consider  that  other  liquidity  providers  should  include  firms  that 
hold  themselves  out  as  being  willing  to  deal  on  own  account,  and  which  provide 
liquidity  as  part  of  their  normal  business  activity,  whether  or  not  they  have  formal 
agreements in place or commit to providing liquidity on a continuous basis. 

In  order  to  have  clear  transparency  on  the  quality  of  execution  for  transactions  in 
relation to price, it is appropriate to require that when publishing information on price, 
the price should exclude all commissions or accrued interest when relevant. 

In determining appropriate information for assessing price quality, both daily average 
levels and point-in-time information should be required. This will provide participants 
with an appropriate context and a more complete picture when analysing the quality of 
execution  obtained.  In  order  to  allow  for  price  comparisons  between  financial 
instruments  it  is  also  necessary  to  specify  the  currency  code  of  any  reported 
transaction.  

(10)

  To  ensure  regulatory  consistency,  it  is  not  appropriate  to  require  trading  venues  to 
provide  details  of  transactions  that  are  still,  at  the  time  of  publication,  subject  to  a 
deferral of publication in compliance with requirements on post trade transparency. It 

EN 

 

519 

  EN 

 
 

 

 

(11)

 

is  also  appropriate  that  systematic  internalisers,  market  makers  and  other  liquidity 
providers  be  exempt  from  publishing  point-in-time  transaction  data  for  any 
transactions above standard market size or size specific to the financial instrument in 
order  to  avoid  those  venues  becoming  subject  to  undue  risk  of  disclosing 
commercially sensitive information that might hinder their ability to hedge exposures 
and provide liquidity. For shares, exchanges traded funds and certificates deemed to be 
illiquid under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the standard market size threshold to be 
used  will  be  the  minimum  available  standard  market  size  for  that  type  of  financial 
instrument. To avoid uncertainty, it is appropriate to clarify that reference to large in 
scale and size specific to the financial instrument follow the same meaning as set out 
in the post trade transparency requirements.  

It  is  essential  for  the  public  to  have  full  transparency  on  all  costs  charged  when 
executing  an  order  through  a  given  venue.  In  determining  the  total  costs  relevant  to 
execution  it  is  necessary  to  specify  all  the  relevant  costs  in  the  execution  of  a  client 
order  related  to  the  use  of  a  specific  venue  and  for  which  the  client  pays  directly  or 
indirectly.  Those  costs  should  include  execution  fees,  including  fees  for  the 
submission,  modification  or  cancellation  of  orders  or  quotes  withdrawals,  as  well  as 
any fees related to market data access or use of terminals. The relevant costs may also 
include  clearing  or  settlement  fees  or  any  other  fees  paid  to  third  parties  involved  in 
the execution of the order when they are part of the services provided by the execution 
venue. Information on costs should also include taxes or levies directly invoiced to, or 
incurred by the venue on behalf of the members or users of the execution venue or the 
client to whom the order refers.   

(12)

  Likelihood  of  execution  indicates  the  probability  of  execution  of  a  particular  type  of 
order and is supported by details on trading volumes in a particular instrument or other 
characteristics  of  orders  and  transactions.  Information  on  likelihood  of  execution 
should allow for the calculation of metrics such as the relative market size of a venue 
in  a  particular  financial  instrument  or  a  class  of  financial  instruments.  Likelihood  of 
execution  should  also  be  assessed  with  data  on  failed  transactions  or  cancelled  or 
modified  orders.  These  metrics  should  allow  participants  to  assess  the  likelihood  of 
execution of a specific financial instrument on a specific venue. 

(13)

  Speed of execution may have different  meanings for the different  types of execution 
venues  as  the  measurement  of  speed  varies  by  both  trading  systems  and  trading 
platform. For continuous auction order books, speed of execution should be expressed 
in mili-seconds while for other trading systems it is appropriate to use larger units of 
time.  It  is  also  appropriate  to  exclude  the  latency  of  a  particular  participant's 
connection  to  the  execution  venue,  as  this  is  outside  of  the  control  of  the  execution 
venue itself. 

(14)

 

In  order  to  compare  the  quality  of  execution  for  orders  of  different  size,  execution 
venues  should  be  required  to  report  on  transactions  within  several  size  ranges.  The 

EN 

 

520 

  EN 

 
 

 

 

thresholds for these ranges must be dependent on the type of financial instrument and 
its liquidity to ensure that they provide an adequate sample of executions in a size that 
is typical in that instrument.  

(15)

 

It is important that execution venues collect data throughout the normal hours of their 
operation. Reporting should  therefore be made without  charge in  a machine readable 
electronic format via an internet website to enable the public to download, search, sort 
and analyse all the provided data. 

(16)

  The  reports  by  execution  venues  should  be  complemented  by  the  output  of  a 
consolidated tape provider established by Directive 2014/65/EU thus allowing for the 
development of enhanced measures of execution quality. 

(17)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date. 

(18)

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission. 

(19)

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and 
benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group 
established  by  Article  37  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council3.
