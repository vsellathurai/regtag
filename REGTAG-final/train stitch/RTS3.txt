THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  

Having  regard  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/20121, and in particular Articles 5(9) and 22(4),  
Whereas:

Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  requires  competent  authorities  and  the  European 
Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  to  perform  a  significant  number  of 
calculations  in  order  to  calibrate  the  applicability  of  the  pre-trade  and  post-  trade 
transparency regime and the trading obligation for derivatives as well as to determine 
whether an investment firm is a systematic internaliser.  

In order to perform the necessary calculations, both competent authorities and ESMA 
need  to  be  able  to  obtain  robust  and  high  quality  data  for  each  asset  class  to  which 
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 applies. The provisions in this Regulation will improve 
both  the  accessibility  and  the  quality  of  data  available  to  competent  authorities  and 
ESMA  in  accordance  with  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of 
the  Council  of  15  May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and  amending 
Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU2  and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 
so  that  the  classification  of  financial  instruments,  including  the  thresholds  for  the 
purposes  of  pre-trade  and  post-trade  transparency,  and,  where  necessary,  re-
calibrations of these thresholds, can be calculated on a more informed basis after the 
regime has been applied for a certain period of time.

This  Regulation  sets  out  the  provisions  specifying,  in  general  terms,  the  common 
elements  with  regard  to  the  content  and  format  of  data  to  be  submitted  by  trading 
venues,  approved  publication  arrangements  (APAs)  and  consolidated  tape  providers 
(CTPs)  for  the  purposes  of  transparency  and  other  calculations.  It  should  be  read  in 
conjunction with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No xx/xxxx [Transparency 
for  equity  and  equity-like  instruments],  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No 
xx/xxxx 
instruments],  Commission  Delegated 
Regulation (EU) No xx/xxxx [Liquid Market for equity and equity-like], Commission 
Delegated Regulation  (EU) No xx/xxx [Definition of SI] and Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) xx/xxxx [Trading obligation 32(6) TS] in which the methodology and 
data necessary to perform the relevant calculations are described and which specify the 
content  and  scope  of  the  data  necessary  to  perform  the  transparency  calculations.  
Therefore, the  content, format and quality of the data submitted should  be consistent 
with the applicable methodology prescribed when performing such calculations.

  With the exception of potential ad-hoc data requests and calculations to be performed 
for the purposes of the Volume cap mechanism, this Regulation should require trading 
venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  to  submit  reports  on  a  daily  basis.  Considering  the  broad 
scope of financial instruments covered and the large amount of data to be processed, 
this daily submission enables competent authorities to more accurately process files of 
manageable  sizes  and  ensures  an  efficient  and  timely  management  of  the  data 
submission,  data  quality  check  and  data  processing.  Collecting  data  on  a  daily  basis 
also  simplifies  the  data  provision  obligation  on  trading  venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  by 
alleviating them from the burden of calculating the number of trading days in the cases 
where that quantitative liquidity criterion is applicable, and of aggregating data for the 
same financial instrument across different time maturity buckets in the cases where the 
time  to  maturity  has  to  be  considered.  Centralising  that  calculation  also  ensures  a 
consistent use of the criteria across financial instruments and trading venues.  

(5)

 

Trading  venues  should  store  data  that  is  comprehensive  and  allows  competent 
authorities  and  ESMA  to  perform  accurate  calculations.  While  the  required 
information  is  usually  provided  in  the  post-trade  reports,  in  some  cases,  the 
information  necessary  for  the  calculations  goes  beyond  the  information  available  in 
those reports. This includes, for example, information on transactions executed on the 
basis of orders that benefitted from the large in scale waiver. This information should 
not  be  included  in  trade  reports  since  it  could  expose  such  transactions  to  adverse 
market  impact.  However,  since  that  information  might  be  necessary  for  competent 
authorities  to  perform  accurate  calculations,  it  should  be  stored  appropriately  by 
trading  venues  and  CTPs  and  communicated  to  competent  authorities  and  ESMA 
where  necessary.  Trading  venues  should  ensure  that  they  adequately  disseminate  the 
information to be provided to competent authorities and ESMA. Transactions executed 
on the basis of large in scale orders should be appropriately identified in their report to 
CTPs.

Data  should  be  collected  from  a  variety  of  sources  since  a  single  source  may  not 
always  hold  a  complete  data  set  for  an  asset  class  or  even  a  particular  instrument. 
Therefore,  to  allow  competent  authorities  and  ESMA  to  obtain  and  consolidate  high 
quality data from various sources, trading venues, APAs and CTPs should use, where 
available,  pre-set  specifications  in  terms  of  content  and  format  in  order  to  make  the 
data  collection  easier  and  more  cost  efficient.  This  should  also  facilitate  the 
automation  to  the  extent  possible  of  any  future  re-classifications  of  financial 
instruments and any recalibrations of thresholds.  

Considering the sensitivity of the necessary calculations and the potential commercial 
consequences  for  trading  venues,  issuers  and  other  market  participants  of  publishing 
incorrect information which could lead, in the case of the volume cap mechanism, to 
the suspension of the use of the waivers for one particular venue or across the Union 
for one particular financial instrument, it is crucial to clarify the format of the data to 
be  submitted  to  competent  authorities  and  ESMA  in  order  to  set  up  efficient 
communication channels with trading venues and CTPs and ensure timely and correct 
publication of the required data. 

Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires ESMA to publish, for financial instruments to 
which  the  volume  cap  mechanism  applies,  measurements  of  the  total  volume  of 
trading  in  the  previous  12  months  and  of  the  percentages  of  trading  under  both  the 
negotiated  trade  and  reference  price  waivers  across  the  Union  and  on  each  trading 
venue in the previous 12 months. In case of financial instruments traded in more than 
one  currency,  it  is  hence  necessary  to  convert  the  volumes  executed  in  different 
currencies  into  one  common  currency  so  as  to  enable  the  computation  of  those 
volumes and make the required calculations. Therefore, this Regulation should set out 
the  methodology  and  exchange  rates  to  be  used  to  convert,  where  necessary,  trading 
volumes.  

For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, this Regulation requires trading venues 
to  report  the  volumes  of  trading  executed  under  the  reference  price  waiver  and,  for 
liquid instruments, the negotiated trade waiver. Given that the waivers apply to orders 
and not to transactions, it is important to clarify that the volumes to be reported should 
include all transactions flagged with  “RFPT” or “NLIQ” for the purpose of the post-
trade publication of transactions and as specified in Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU)  No  xx/xxxx[Transparency  for  equity  and  equity-like  instruments].  Where  a 
transaction was executed on the basis of two orders benefitting from the large in scale 
waiver,  this  transaction  should  not  count  towards  the  volumes  calculated  under  the 
reference price waiver and the negotiated trade waiver. 

(10)

  For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues and CTPs should ensure 
that  the  trading  venue  on  which  the  transaction  was  executed  is  identified  with 
sufficient  granularity  to  allow  ESMA  to  perform  all  calculations  set  out  under 
Regulation  (EU) No 600/2014.  In particular, the  trading venue identifier used should 
be unique for that trading venue and not shared with any other trading venue operated 

EN 

176 

EN 

 
 

 

 

(11)

by  the  same  market  operator.  Trading  venue  identifiers  should  allow  ESMA  to 
distinguish in an unequivocal manner all trading venues for which the market operator 
has received a specific authorisation under Directive 2014/65/EU.  

  Under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the period for which trading under the reference 
price  waiver  and,  for  liquid  financial  instruments,  negotiated  transaction  waiver  is  to 
be monitored starts on 3 January 2016. To this end, it is necessary to establish in this 
Regulation  a provision requiring trading venues  to  submit a first  report on 3 January 
2017 with trading volumes for the year 2016. To ensure a proportionate application of 
this  requirement,  trading  venues  should,  for  that  purpose,  base  their  report  on  the 
adjusted  volumes  of  trading  executed  under  equivalent  waivers  existing  under 
Directive  2004/39/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council 3  and 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/20064. 

(12)

 

In  order  to  provide  competent  authorities  and  ESMA  with  accurate  data,  trading 
venues,  APAs  and  CTPs  should  ensure  that  their  reports  include  single-counted 
transactions only. 

(13)

  The  provisions  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked,  since  they  deal  with  specifying 
the content, frequency, format of data requests, the method to be used to process  this 
data and other specifications relating to the publication of information for the purposes 
of transparency as defined under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. To ensure coherence 
between those provisions, which will enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate 
a  comprehensive  view  for  stakeholders,  and  in  particular  those  subject  to  the 
obligations,  it  is  desirable  to  include  these  regulatory  technical  standards  in  a  single 
Regulation. 

(14)

  The  new  legislation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  markets  in 
financial  instruments  set  out  in  Directive  2014/65/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No 
600/2014 applies from 3 January 2017. To ensure consistency and legal certainty, this 
Regulation should apply from the same date.

  This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the 

ESMA to the Commission.

  ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical 
standards  on  which  this  Regulation  is  based,  analysed  the  potential  related  costs  and

Regulation  (EU)  No  600/2014  and  where  requested  by  the  competent  authority,  CTPs  shall 
submit to the competent authority the following data: 

EN 

180 

EN 

 
 

 

 

(a)  the total volumes of trading in the financial instrument executed on all trading venues in  

the Union with total volumes reported separately for each trading venue; 

(b)  the  total  volumes  of  trading  executed  on  all  trading  venues  in  the  Union falling  under 
the waivers of Article 4(1)(a) or 4(1)(b)(i) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 respectively 
with total volumes reported separately for each waiver and for each trading venue.   

3.  Trading  venues  and  CTPs  shall  report  the  data  set  out  in  paragraphs  1  and  2  using  the 
formats  provided  in  the  Annex.  They  shall,  in  particular,  ensure  that  the  trading  venue 
identifiers they provide are sufficiently granular to enable the competent authority and ESMA 
to  identify  the  volumes  of  trading  executed  under  the  reference  price  waiver  and,  for  liquid 
financial instruments, under the negotiated trade waiver of each trading venue and allow for 
the calculation of the ratio set out under Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. 

4.  For the purposes of the calculation of the volumes referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: 

(a)  the volume of an individual transaction shall be determined by multiplying the price of 

the financial instrument by the number of units traded;  

(b)  the total  volume of trading  in  each  financial instrument  set  out  in  paragraphs 1(a) and 
2(a) shall be determined by aggregating the volume of all individual and single-counted 
transactions for that financial instrument.  

(c)  the  trading  volumes  set  out  in  paragraphs  1(b)  and  2(b)  shall  be  determined  by 
aggregating the volumes of individual and single-counted transactions for that financial 
instrument  reported  under  the  flags  “reference  price”  and  “negotiated  transactions  in 
liquid  financial  instruments”  in  accordance  with  Table  4  of  Annex  I  of  Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) No xx/xxxx [Equity transparency]. 

5.  Trading  venues  and  CTPs  shall  only  aggregate  transactions  executed  in  the  same 
currency  and  shall  report  separately  each  aggregated  volume  in  the  currency  used  for  the 
transactions. 

6.  Trading venues shall submit the data referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 on the first and the 
sixteenth day of each calender month byt 13:00 CET to the competent authority. If the first or 
the  sixteenth  day  of  the  calendar  month  is  a  non-working  day  for  the  trading  venue,  the 
trading venue shall report the data to the competent authority by 13:00 CET on the following 
working day.  

7.  Trading venues shall submit the total volume determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 
to 5 and executed in respect of the following time periods: 

(a)  for  the  reports  to  be  submitted  on  the  sixteenth  day  of  each  calendar  month,  the 

execution period is from the first day to the fifteenth day of the same calendar month; 

EN 

181 

EN 

 
 

 

 

(b)  for  the  reports  to  be  submitted  on  the  first  day  of  each  calendar  month,  the  execution 

period is from the sixteenth day to the last day of the previous calendar month. 

8.  By way of derogation to paragraphs 6 and 7, trading venues shall submit the first  report 
per  financial  instrument  on  3  January  2017  by  13:00  CET  and  shall  include  the  trading 
volumes  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  from  3  January  2016  to  31  December  2016.  For  this 
purpose, trading venues shall report separately, for each calendar month: 

(a)  the  trading  volumes  during  the  period  from  the  first  day  to  the  fifteenth  day  of  each 

calendar month;   

(b)  the  trading  volumes  during  the  period  from  the  sixteenth  day  to  the  last  day  of  each 

calendar month.  

9.  Trading venues and CTPs shall respond to any ad hoc request from competent authorities 
on the volume of trading in relation to the calculation to be performed for monitoring the use 
of  the  reference  price  or  negotiated  trade  waivers  by  close  of  business  on  the  next  working 
day following the request.

Reporting requirements for competent authorities to ESMA for the purposes of the 

volume cap mechanism and the trading obligation for derivatives 

1.  Competent  authorities shall provide ESMA with the data received from  a trading venue 
or a CTP in accordance  with Article 6 by 13:00  CET on the next working day following its 
receipt. 

2.  Competent authorities shall provide ESMA with the data received from a trading venue, 
APA  or  CTP  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether  derivatives  are  sufficiently  liquid  as 
referred to in Article 1(h) without undue delay and no later than three working days following 
its receipt.  

 

Article 8 

Reporting requirements for ESMA for the purpose of the volume cap mechanism  

1.  ESMA’s publication, in accordance with Article 5(4), (5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 
600/2014, of measurements of the total volume of trading for each financial instrument in the 
previous  12  months  and  of  the  percentages  of  trading  under  both  the  negotiated  trade  and 
reference  price  waivers  across  the  Union  and  on  each  trading  venue  in  the  previous  12 
months, shall be made no later than 22.00 CET on the fifth working day following the end of 
the reporting periods set out in Article 6(6).

[European  Comission  Delegated  Regulation  on  definitions,  transparency,  derivatives  and 
supervisory measures on product intervention and positions (MiFIR)].  

3.  Where  a  financial  instrument  is  traded  in  more  than  one  currency  across  the  Union, 
ESMA  shall  convert  all  volumes  into  EUR  using  average  exchange  rates  calculated  on  the 
basis  of  the  daily  euro  foreign  exchange  reference  rates  published  by  the  European  Central 
Bank on its website in the previous 12 months. Those converted volumes shall be used for the 
calculation  and  publication  of  the  total  volume  of  trading  and  of  the  percentages  of  trading 
under  both  the  negotiated  trade  and  reference  price  waivers  across  the  Union  and  on  each 
trading venue as referred to in paragraph 1.
